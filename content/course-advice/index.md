## Introduction

This purpose of this article is to provide some guidance on what computer
science electives you might want to consider when preparing for jobs in industry
as a software engineer. Since I graduated from University of Washington with a
B.S. in computer engineering, I use the
[UW CSE department's courses](https://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/)
as examples throughout. A lot of CS programs have similar courses so students
could still follow along.

I break down the suggestions into 3 common software engineer titles:

- [Frontend Engineer](#frontend-engineer)
- [Backend Engineer](#backend-engineer)
- [Data Scientist](#data-scientist)

To conclude, I give some general advice that would apply to all students seeking
a job as a software engineer, not matter the specialty. I give my opinions on
the hardest and easiests courses, as well as courses I think everyone should
take.

To limit the scope of this article, I don't include classes that are:

- **Required for CSE majors**--you have to take those classes anyway.
- **Prerequisites**. If CSE451 is suggested, it is implied that CSE333 should
  also be taken.
- **Special topics courses.** Since these courses are always changing, I'm only
  including courses in the core cirriculum.
- **Graduate level.** This document is aimed at undergrads, so I exclude 5xx
  classes.

## Frontend Engineer

This list is for people interested in:

- user interface design
- user experience research
- web or mobile development

To be honest, the CSE department doesn't have _that much_ when it comes to
frontend development. If you know you're interested in frontend development, I'd
recommend taking a look at courses in HCDE, INFO, and DESIGN as well.

- [CSE440 Human Computer Interaction](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse440/):
  Teaches design of effective user interfaces and how to user testing. You do a
  quarter long project where you get experience doing user studies and
  implementing a UI prototype. I feel like the skills you take away from this
  class could apply to any specialty in UI development.
- [CSE341 Programming Languages](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse403/):
  This course would be beneficial for people interested in learning JavaScript
  for web development. The course doesn't teach JavaScript per se, but it does
  teach functional programming, which we are seeing a lot more of in
  [modern JavaScript](https://link.medium.com/vHX7Nzr8o7).
- [CSE154 Web Development](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/):
  Introduces HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are the 3 core technologies for
  client-side web development. I've heard the quality of the course has improved
  in recent times so this could be a good one to look out for. If you don't take
  this course, take University of Helskinki's free
  [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course. It is great.
- [CSE340 Interaction Programming](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse340/):
  This is the only class in the CSE department that teaches mobile development.
  I will warn you though, this course is fairly new, and I've heard that some of
  the kinks with logistics still need to be ironed out.

## Backend Engineer

This list is for people interested in:

- developing APIs using REST, GraphQL, etc
- site-reliability and cloud engineering
- lower level systems development

Unlike [frontend](#frontend-engineer)

- [CSE452 Distributed Systems](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse452/):
  Most systems these days are distributed systems. This course will give an
  opportunity to develop distributed, fault tolerant systems.
- [CSE451 Operating Systems](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse451/)
- [CSE444 Database Internals](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse444/)

### Also consider

- [CSE469 Computer Architecture](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse469/):
  Getting a deeper understanding of how a CPU works is extremely valuable,
  _especially_ if you're interested in systems engineering.
- [CSE461 Networks](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse461/): This
  course is great for learning a lot of the terminology in computer networks and
  getting some practical experience networking. Take this class when the TOR
  project is offered.
- [CSE401 Compilers](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse401/): As a
  platform engineer, you may need to kn

## Data Scientist

If you know you want to data science, UW offers a
[Data Science option](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/courses/data-science),
which is fairly close to the courses I list here.

- [CSE446 Machine Learning](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse446/):
  ML permuates a lot of modern AI, from recommender systems, image recognition,
  language processing, etc.
- [CSE442 Data Visualization](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse442/):
  A big portion of a data scientist's job is visualizing data.
- [CSE444 Database Internals](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse444/):
  Data is often stored in relational databases; knowing how these sytems are
  implemented can provide valuable insight.

### Also consider

- [CSE469 Computer Architecture](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse469/):
  Why do we care about GPUs and vectorization for machine learning? Learning
  computer architecture can give you invaluable perspective when developing data
  mining systems.
- [CSE473 Artificial Intelligence](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse473/):
  This is a nice course for dipping your toes into AI. It's not too heavy on the
  math, and gives a nice intro to a lot of AI topics including reinforcement
  learning, which has seen growth in popularity.

UW CSE also offers other courses that cover some niche areas in AI.

- [CSE447 Natural Language Processing](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse447/)
- [CSE455 Computer Vision](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse455/)
- [CSE478 Autonomous Robotics](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse478/)
- [CSE427 Computational Biology](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse427/)

There's also quite a bit of special topics AI courses that pop up frequently, so
watch out for those too.

## General advice

Below are some courses that would benefit any software engineer, no matter the
speciality.

- [CSE421 Algorithms](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse421/): Most
  tech companies want you to be able to solve algorithms/data structures
  problems. This course will you help you develop a mental framework for
  understanding algorithms.
- [CSE403 Software Engineering](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse403/):
  This is an article about computer science courses to take for software
  engineering, right? This course lets you work on a quarter-long project where
  you learn the software development lifecycle. I've heard mixed reviews about
  this course, as it may not be much "new" material after
  [CSE331](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse331/). Still, it's
  probably still one of the more practical CSE courses you could take.
- [CSE484 Computer Security](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse484/):
  No matter what you do as a software engineer, you should have some awareness
  about security.

I recommend exploring a variety of the courses while in undergrad. This is a
great time to figure out what you actually like to do. I would advise not to
study a subject just because it is trendy, because that will be an constant
uphill battle. As cliche as it sounds, find an area you're interested in, run
with that, and there will be opportunities for you.

### Challenging courses

Often I find the most challenging courses that students find most rewarding.
Here's what I think were the most challenging CSE courses, in no particular
order:

- [CSE451 Operating Systems](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse451/):
  Debugging concurrent systems is hard. This course starts you off with a fairly
  complete OS kernel that you get to extend throughout the quarter.
- [CSE452 Distributed Systems](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse452/):
  Debugging concurrent systems is hard, especially when we can't rely on network
  connections to send messages or rely on nodes to not crash.
- [CSE446 Machine Learning](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse446/):
  This course can be a _lot_ of math, depending on who teaches it. You should
  feel comfortable (or ready to re-learn) linear algebra, calculus, stats, and
  probability before taking this course.
- [CSE469 Computer Architecture](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse469/):
  You implement a 5-stage pipelining CPU in SystemVerilog.
- [CSE421 Algorithms](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse421/): If
  CSE311 and CSE332 had a baby, it would be this course. Get ready to prove
  correctness of all your favorite algorithms.

### Easiest courses

These courses are good to take while you're taking other hard courses
concurrently.

- [CSE484 Computer Security](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse451/):
  3 reasonably sized labs that you can work on in groups of 3. No midterm/final.
  Easy final project. Possibly the lightest workload of all the CSE classes.
- [CSE341 Programming Languages](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse451/):
  This course might feel harder if you're newer to CS or don't have much
  exposure to languages outside of Java. Otherwise, it's often considered one of
  the easiest CSE courses.
- [CSE473 Artificial Intelligence](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse473/):
  The bulk of the work is 4 labs where you implement AI's for Pacman. This
  course is often considered one of the easier courses.
