This article is geared toward 3rd year computer science students or people that
have some basic programming experience. The student would know about loops,
conditional statements, function calls,

## 1. Data Structures

It doesn't matter what part of the stack you are working on, software engineers
need to develop
[Data Structures](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse332/) to
represent models of the world. In this course, you will learn what it means to
make abstractions, and you were learn about the abstractions that are commonly
used to solve problems. You will learn that some problems are best respresented
as lists, like [stacks](https://skies.dev/blog/stacks) and queues. You will
learn more complex structures like trees and graphs. You will learn the basic
sorting and searching algorithms. This course teaches you directly the skills
that are often tested during software engineer interviews.

## 2. Algorithms

[CSE421 Algorithms](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse421/)

- For practice implementing algorithms,
  [Algorithms - Princeton University](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1).
- Then, as a follow up, you how to analyze and prove algorithms with
  [Algorithms Specialization - Stanford University](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms?).

## 3. Programming Languages

[Programming Languages](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse403/)

- To learn and practice programming paradigms,
  [Programming Languages - University of Washington](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages?).

## 4. Computer Architecture

[Computer Architecture](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse469/)

To learn computer architecture, check out the popular
[Nand to Tetris](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer?) and its
supplementing
[Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer).

## 5. Operating Systems

[Operating Systems](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse451/)

## 6. Compilers

[Compilers](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse401/)

## 7. Computer Networks

[Networks](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse461/)

## 8. Distributed Systems

[Distributed Systems](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse452/)

For learning distributed systems, do
[dslabs](https://github.com/emichael/dslabs). Disclaimer, these labs are
**hard**. You will get hands on experience developing a fault tolerant, highly
available, sharded key-value store. The materials for doing the labs are self
contained in the repo linked. Google around when necessary to learn the
materials to do the labs. Keywords include:

- Primary-Backup
- Paxos, and Multi-Paxos variant
- Sharding

## 9. Database Systems

[Database Internals](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse444/)

To learn databases, complete the SimpleDB project. The
[lab specifications](https://github.com/MIT-DB-Class/course-info-2018) and
[project repo](https://github.com/MIT-DB-Class/simple-db-hw) are all you need to
complete these labs. Again, Google is your friend for searching and learning
about things as needed. Keywords include:

- SQL query language
- Database Transactions
- Two-phase commit protocol

## 10. Computer Security

[Computer Security](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse484/)

## Bonus Courses

Technology is always evolving. Here are 2 more courses that could be of interest
depending on interest.

### 11. Human-Computer Interaction

[Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse440/)
is espially useful for those interested in front-end engineering. In this
course, you learn how to design novel interfaces. There are patterns when
designing for different technologies, from web and mobile interfaces, to
point-of-sale systems and ATM machines. This course will teach you principals on
designing interfaces that are easy and enjoyable to use.

Learn more about HCI and designing user interfaces with the following books:

- [Don't Make Me Think - Steve Krug](https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758)
- [Refactoring UI](https://refactoringui.com/)

### 12. Machine Learning

The time is now. Machine Learning is all around us. This course will teach you
about the basics of the algorithms that recommend videos on YouTube, serve
personalized ads, self-drive cars, and guess "hot dog" or "not hot dog".

**Spoiler alert:** It's math. In particular,

- linear algebra
- probability
- statistics
- calculus

We use probability and statistics to make predictions and linear algebra to
process many rows and columns of data in parallel. This course will demystify
the technology behind machine learning and has been a viable career path in
recent times.

To learn Machine Learning, check out these resources:

- [Machine Learning - Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
- [Deep Learning - Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

If you want to go deep with designing novel machine learning algebra, you should
study the mathematics I listed above.
