What constitutes as clean code? Is it

- Functions that do one thing well?
- Easy-to-understand variable names and abstractions?
- Reduced amount of code duplication?

The thing is, there is **no such thing** as code that would be considered clean
code universally. What _Developer A_ thinks is clean code, _Developer B_ scoffs
at. There are **tribal wars** over what people believe is the correct way to
write code. We argue over

- The use of semicolons in JavaScript
- Whether you should indent with tabs or spaces
- Whether you should indent with 4 spaces or 2 spaces

Most of the time, the "arguments" are just for some internet humor.

So is there such thing as clean code? Yes. But what is considered clean code is
going to vary from project to project, team to team. Many projects have tooling
that make it easy to write code that conforms to a particular **style guide**.

## Use Lint Tools

![tools](tools.jpg)

What is deemed ‚Äúclean code‚Äù is going to vary from project to project. If you‚Äôre
working on a project with a team, there will probably be a defined style guide
and **lint tools** to help enforce it.

<p>
A <strong>linter</strong> is software that modifies code to enforce the rules of a style guide.

If you are working on your own project that you plan to grow over time, you
should take the time to set up lint tooling. You can use GitHub to
[create a template repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-template-repository)
so that you don‚Äôt have to worry about setting it up each time.

### Tools I Like

The linters I like to use in greenfield projects are as follows:

- For **C/C++**, [Clang-Tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/).
- For **Java**, I like IntelliJ's ability to
  [reformat and rearrange code](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/reformat-and-rearrange-code.html).
- For **JavaScript**, [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) does a good job.
- For **Python**, VS Code has
  [good support](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting).
- For **Markdown**, **HTML**, **JSON**, and **YAML**,
  [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is a good option with good
  [VS Code support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode).

Once you‚Äôve picked a linter for your project, you now need to configure it with
a style guide. Here are some popular style guides I like:

- For **C/C++**,
  [Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)
- For **Java**,
  [Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)
- For **JavaScript**, [AirBnb Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- For **Python**, [PEP 8 Style Guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

## Clean Code for One != Clean Code for All

![clean office](office.jpg)

[Clean Code](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-code/9780136083238/)
by Uncle Bob Martin is a popular book for those interested in learning some
philosophies of writing clean code.

However, it is important to recognize what _you think is clean code may not be
what someone else thinks is clean code_. For example, after reading Clean Code,
I was excited to start applying the code style Martin taught. The style is
extremely modular, with very few lines of code per method. Small classes, small
everything.

I was hooked. The thought of getting potential code reuse down the line excited
me. I thought the abstractions and names I gave made the code clearer to read
and easier to understand.

The developer I was working with didn‚Äôt agree. There were methods and
abstractions everywhere for everything. You had to bounce around the file to
understand what was going on in the code. _There was more complexity in how
everything interacted._

Reading Clean Code made me aware of common patterns and code smells that come up
when writing software. The book does a great job at taking to the extreme what
constitutes as clean code and is a great starting point for someone interested
in improving their code quality.

However, from that project experience, I learned what I believe is clean code
may not be what other developers believe is clean code. In retrospect, an agreed
upon style guide could have prevented the issue and enabled a coding environment
that made us both more productive.

## How to Write Clean Code

![a white and blue wall](wall.jpg)

To write clean code, your safest bet is to conform to the style guide of the
project.

- If the project uses descriptive variable names, then the code you add should
  have descriptive variable names.
- If the project uses short functions, then the functions you write should be
  short as well.
- If the project indents with 4 spaces, then you should also ident with 4 spaces
  _even if you prefer to indent with 2 spaces_.

Don't get hung up trying to indoctrinate your style preferences on other
developers. We all have our different beliefs about what we consider clean code.

Do use lint tooling to automate conforming to the project's style guide. If
there is no style guide defined, [adopt one](#tools-i-like). Keep the reader in
mind when writing code. Ask yourself, "If I were to look at this code one year
from now, would I understand what is going on?"

<aside><p>Try looking at code from one of your old projects. Do you remember how the code works? Is the code easy to understand? If so, great! Perhaps you have written <em>clean code</em>.&nbsp;

### Summary

- Read
  [Martin‚Äôs book](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)
  to learn principles of writing clean code.
- Code according to the project‚Äôs style guide.
- Use lint tools to help conform to the style guide.
