## What Are Unit Tests?

Unit tests are for testing an _atomic piece_ of functionality in a software
system.

We are tasked with writing the code for an **account** in the banking system.

> **Note**
>
> Our examples use TypeScript instead of JavaScript so that we can explicitly
> see the types in our API.

Our product team is telling us that clients:

- Should be able to create a new account with any value greater than or equal
  to 0.
- Should be able to see the balance of an account.
- Should be able to deposit any amount greater than 0.
- Should be able to withdraw any amount greater than 0 as long as sufficient
  funds are available.

With this, we come up with the following skeleton class. We know the account
should maintain the state of the balance so we will add that as a member.

```ts
// account.ts

export default class Account {
  private _balance: number;
}
```

We set the balance as a _private_ member because we don't want our clients to
access the fields directly—potentially setting the balance to some wacky value.

```TypeScript
// client.ts

const account = new Account();

// ❌ We don't want clients to be able to do this.
account.balance = Number.NaN;
```

Instead, we want clients to go through our interface in order to change the
balance. This concept is known as
[encapsulation](https://stackify.com/oop-concept-for-beginners-what-is-encapsulation/).

```TypeScript
// client.ts

const account = new Account();

// ✔️ Clients use our API to deposit an amount
account.deposit(10);

// ✔️ They can also withdraw an amount
account.withdraw(5);
```

We can take the system requirements given to us by the product team and start
writing tests.

The practice of writing tests _before_ writing the implementation is known as
**test-driven development (TDD)** and it is often praised as good practice in
the software development community.

With that, let's get started!

## Writing Our First Unit Tests

https://twitter.com/shanselman/status/992599087076683776?s=20

We can look at the first requirement given to us by the product team.

> Should be able to create a new account with any value greater than or equal
> to 0.

Let's go ahead and create a `__tests__/account.test.ts` right next to our
`account.ts` file. This is where we will write all of our tests.

We will use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) to test our code. Jest is a popular
framework for testing JavaScript. However, learning the Jest framework is beyond
the scope of this article. I will do my best to keep things simple so that you
can still follow along even if you're new to Jest.

When writing unit tests, we can't possibly test all possible inputs. That would
be a waste of compute and take a very long time.

Instead, we want to think about the boundary conditions on our domain and test
around those boundary conditions.

![An abstract diagram showing boundaries in a domain.](boundary.png)

The boundary condition in our `Account` class is mentioned right in the
requirement.

> Any value greater than or equal to 0.

Knowing this, we can set up our tests to test along the boundaries. Namely,

- Values around 0
- The minimum possible values
- The maximum possible values

We will need to add a constructor to support this functionality. Let's do that
now.

```TypeScript
// account.ts

export default class Account {
  private _balance: number;

  constructor(initialBalance = 0) {
    // TODO: implement this
  }
}
```

Let's go ahead and write our first tests for this requirement.

```TypeScript
// __tests__/account.test.ts

import Account from '../account';

test('should not be able to have a negative initial balance', () => {
  expect(() => new Account(-1)).toThrow();
  expect(() => new Account(Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER)).toThrow();
});

test('should be able to have a positive initial balance', () => {
  expect(new Account()).toBeTruthy();
  expect(new Account(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER)).toBeTruthy();
});
```

With the tests in place, we can go ahead and run them and see they are failing.

Now we'll go into our `Account` class and implement the functionality.

```TypeScript
// account.ts

export default class Account {
  private _balance: number;

  constructor(initialBalance = 0) {
    if (initialBalance < 0) {
      throw Error('initial balance should be >= 0');
    }
    this._balance = initialBalance;
  }
}
```

Now when we run the tests, we should see the tests are passing.

```bash
 PASS  content/unit-tests/__tests__/account.test.ts
  ✓ should not be able to have a negative initial balance (4 ms)
  ✓ should be able to have a positive initial balance (1 ms)
```

Great. Let's look at the next requirement the product team is asking us to
support.

> Should be able to see the balance of an account.

We will add a getter method for the balance so that clients can see the balance
on an account.

```TypeScript
// account.ts

export default class Account {
  private _balance: number;

  constructor(initialBalance = 0) {
    if (initialBalance < 0) {
      throw Error('initial balance should be >= 0');
    }
    this._balance = initialBalance;
  }

  get balance(): number {
    // TODO: implement this
    return -1;
  }
}
```

This will be a super simple method so writing tests may be overkill, but we will
do it anyway to practice TDD.

We'll write the test for this getter as follows.

```TypeScript
//__tests__/account.test.js

test('should be able to return the account balance', () => {
  expect(new Account(1).balance).toBe(1);
  expect(new Account(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER).balance).toBe(
    Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER,
  );
});
```

And now we write the implementation.

```TypeScript
// account.ts

export default class Account {
  private _balance: number;

  constructor(initialBalance = 0) {
    if (initialBalance < 0) {
      throw Error('initial balance should be >= 0');
    }
    this._balance = initialBalance;
  }

  get balance(): number {
    return this._balance;
  }
}
```

Awesome.

We are one step closer to having a fully functioning `Account` class. 💪

## Four Steps of TDD

https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin/status/1205893180681359360?s=20

We are now starting to get into a TDD rhythm.

1. Determine the functionality of the behavior.
2. Design the API (the interface).
3. Write tests that test the behavior of the API.
4. Implement the API.

First, we will determine the functionality we need.

Let's look at the next requirement given to us by the product team.

> Should be able to deposit any amount greater than 0.

We will add a `deposit()` method to our interface that accepts an amount to
deposit which will update the balance. We'll also design it so that the method
returns the updated balance.

Let's add the following method stub for the `deposit()` method.

```TypeScript
// account.ts

export default class Account {
  private _balance: number;

  constructor(initialBalance = 0) {
    if (initialBalance < 0) {
      throw Error('initial balance should be >= 0');
    }
    this._balance = initialBalance;
  }

  get balance(): number {
    return this._balance;
  }

  deposit(amount: number): number {
    return -1;
  }
}
```

Now, we'll implement the tests for our `deposit()` method.

```TypeScript
//__tests__/account.test.js

test('should be able to deposit any amount > 0', () => {
  const account = new Account();
  account.deposit(1);
  expect(account.balance).toBe(1);
  account.deposit(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER - 1);
  expect(account.balance).toBe(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER);
});

test('should not be able to deposit any amount <= 0', () => {
  const account = new Account();
  expect(() => account.deposit(0)).toThrow();
  expect(() => account.deposit(-1)).toThrow();
  expect(() => account.deposit(Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER)).toThrow();
});

test('should return new balance after depositing', () => {
  const account = new Account();
  for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i += 1) {
    expect(account.deposit(1)).toBe(i);
  }
});
```

Finally, we will move on with the implementation.

```TypeScript
// account.ts

export default class Account {
  private _balance: number;

  constructor(initialBalance = 0) {
    if (initialBalance < 0) {
      throw Error('initial balance should be >= 0');
    }
    this._balance = initialBalance;
  }

  get balance(): number {
    return this._balance;
  }

  deposit(amount: number): number {
    if (amount <= 0) {
      throw Error('deposit amount must be > 0');
    }
    this._balance += amount;
    return this._balance;
  }
}
```

Perfect, all the tests we've added so far pass.

```bash
 PASS  content/unit-tests/__tests__/account.test.ts
  ✓ should not be able to have a negative initial balance (4 ms)
  ✓ should be able to have a positive initial balance (1 ms)
  ✓ should be able to return the account balance
  ✓ should be able to deposit any amount > 0
  ✓ should not be able to deposit any amount <= 0 (1 ms)
  ✓ should return new balance after depositing (2 ms)
```

## Practice Writing Unit Tests

Before you move on, try and carry out the four steps of TDD for the `withdraw()`
method.

Recall, the product team gave us this requirement:

> Should be able to withdraw any positive amount as long as sufficient funds are
> available.

So don't scroll down further until you're ready to see the solution.

The practice will help you learn about unit tests and TDD better.

Did you do it?

Are you sure?

Yeah?

Ok, I will go ahead and implement this so I hope you tried it yourself! 😊

Step 1: gather requirements. We got this already from the product team.

Step 2: design the API. The API will work similarly to `deposit()` but it will
remove an amount instead of add an amount to the account.

```TypeScript
// account.ts

export default class Account {
  private _balance: number;

  constructor(initialBalance = 0) {
    if (initialBalance < 0) {
      throw Error('initial balance should be >= 0');
    }
    this._balance = initialBalance;
  }

  get balance(): number {
    return this._balance;
  }

  deposit(amount: number): number {
    if (amount <= 0) {
      throw Error('deposit amount must be > 0');
    }
    this._balance += amount;
    return this._balance;
  }

  withdraw(amount: number): number {
    // TODO: implement this
    return -1;
  }
}
```

Step 3: write tests against the API.

```TypeScript
//__tests__/account.test.js

test('should not be able to withdraw any amount <= 0', () => {
  const account = new Account();
  expect(() => account.withdraw(0)).toThrow();
  expect(() => account.withdraw(-1)).toThrow();
  expect(() => account.withdraw(Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER)).toThrow();
});

test('should be able to withdraw any amount > 0 given funds are available', () => {
  const account = new Account(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER);
  account.withdraw(1);
  expect(account.balance).toBe(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER - 1);
  account.withdraw(account.balance);
  expect(account.balance).toBe(0);
});

test('should not be able to withdraw an amount if not enough funds are available', () => {
  const account = new Account();
  expect(() => account.withdraw(account.balance + 1)).toThrow();
});

test('should return the new balance after withdrawal', () => {
  const account = new Account(10);
  for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i += 1) {
    expect(account.withdraw(1)).toBe(10 - i);
  }
});
```

Step 4: implement the API.

```TypeScript
// account.ts

export default class Account {
  private _balance: number;

  constructor(initialBalance = 0) {
    if (initialBalance < 0) {
      throw Error('initial balance should be >= 0');
    }
    this._balance = initialBalance;
  }

  get balance(): number {
    return this._balance;
  }

  deposit(amount: number): number {
    if (amount <= 0) {
      throw Error('deposit amount must be > 0');
    }
    this._balance += amount;
    return this._balance;
  }

  withdraw(amount: number): number {
    if (amount <= 0) {
      throw Error('withdraw amount must be > 0');
    }
    if (amount > this._balance) {
      throw Error('amount exceeds balance');
    }
    this._balance -= amount;
    return this._balance;
  }
}
```

As you can see, all of the tests are passing.

```bash
 PASS  content/unit-tests/__tests__/account.test.ts
  ✓ should not be able to have a negative initial balance (4 ms)
  ✓ should be able to have a positive initial balance (1 ms)
  ✓ should be able to return the account balance
  ✓ should be able to deposit any amount > 0
  ✓ should not be able to deposit any amount <= 0 (1 ms)
  ✓ should return new balance after depositing (2 ms)
  ✓ should not be able to withdraw any amount <= 0 (1 ms)
  ✓ should be able to withdraw any amount > 0 given funds are available
  ✓ should not be able to withdraw an amount if not enough funds are available
  ✓ should return the new balance after withdrawal (4 ms)
```

I hope this article helped you learn what unit tests are and how to think about
writing them.

If you're interested in learning more about testing, especially testing with
JavaScript, [Kent C Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/) writes a lot on this
subject. His blog is a great resource for reading more about testing software.
