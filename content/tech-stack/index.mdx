## Introduction

In this article, I'll explain the technology I chose when developing the
[skies.dev](https://www.skies.dev) website.

**TL;DR**: Skies utilizes the JAMstack. The site is statically generated with
Gatsby.js, styled with Tailwind CSS, versioned on GitHub, and hosted on Netlify.

## Gatsby

[Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is an open-source framework I'm using to
drive this site. I chose Gatsby for several reasons.

- **Developer experience**: Gatsby lets me write my application in React and
  handles all the low-level optimizations to get the site ready for production.
- **Plugins**: There are a lot of plugins that make life easy when developing a
  site.
- **Ecosystem**: Gatsby has a great community. There's a lot of help on the
  internet whenever I run into issues.

I bootstrapped the site with the good ol'
[gatsby-starter-default](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default/).

### Plugins

The plugins ecosystem is something that makes Gatsby really special in my
opinion. Two of the many plugins I'm using are

- [gatsby-plugin-mdx](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-mdx/):
  This plugin lets me write blog posts (such as this one) in Markdown/JSX. MDX
  is a convenient way of quickly writing content using markdown but still having
  the flexibility to use React when needed. Gatsby is able to take these MDX
  files and generate web pages from them. Really cool.
- [gatsby-image](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-image): Images are
  often a bottleneck in a website's performance. I use this plugin to handle
  optimizing images for performance so I don't have to think as much about it.

There are many other plugins that I use for other things here and there. Check
out my
[gatsby-config](https://github.com/swkeever/skies.dev/blob/master/gatsby-config.js)
for a look at all the plugins and configurations I'm using.

### TypeScript

Another cool benefit of Gatsby is [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
worked out of the box with the starter I used. Since I've been wanting to get
more comfortable with TypeScript, I used building this site as an opportunity to
learn TypeScript better.

To make things a little simpler on myself, I've set my compiler settings to be
less strict giving me the option to opt out of writing out all the types when
I'm being lazy or am in a hurry. This is not too much of a problem though
because the tooling I've set up reminds me to fix any development shortcuts I
may have made.

## Tooling

Below I list out the tools that I use for continuous integration and continuous
deployment (CI/CD).

### ESLint

I use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to improve the quality of my code. My ESLint
configuration extends the
[Airbnb style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). I use ESLint to help
me with the following.

- **Find code smells**: I'm not a perfect developer. I rely on ESLint to let me
  know when I'm doing something that could potentially cause problems.
- **Enforce code style**: I use ESLint in conjunction with Prettier to format my
  JavaScript.
- **Find accessibility issues**: I use
  [eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y)
  to let me know how I can improve the accessibility of my site. I find this
  really useful for catching little things you can add to your markup to make
  the site more accessible.

### Prettier

ESLint handles JavaScript; Prettier formats just about everything else. I'm
using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to format filetypes such as JSON, HTML,
CSS, etc. Prettier also can play nicely with ESLint using
[eslint-plugin-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-plugin-prettier).

### Husky and lint-staged

[Husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky) and
[lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) help me with CI. With these
tools, I set it up so that formatting, linting, and testing happens all before I
check anything into Git. If any of the formatting, linting, or testing steps
fail, then the code won't be committed to Git. This is a great way to be
reasonably sure that the code I check in will not contain many issues. Knock on
wood. ðŸ˜…

If you want to try these tools, Prettier has
[simple documentation](https://prettier.io/docs/en/precommit.html) for setting
this up.

## Tailwind CSS

I use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) because I wanted my styles to
adhere to a design system, but I didn't want to be locked into a component-based
CSS framework like Bootstrap, as those types of frameworks have given me trouble
in the past when trying to handle nitty-gritty styling details.

Tailwind CSS is [basically just CSS](/blog/learn-css), except I write my "CSS"
as class names. Because I'm not a CSS expert, this is really useful because I
can apply a class and a CSS rule with a sensible value will be set.

For example, let's say I asked you how you would overflow text with an ellipsis
using CSS. Maybe you would know how to do that; I would need to look it up. With
Tailwind, I just apply the `truncate` class and the following CSS rules are
applied. Easy.

```CSS
.truncate {
  overflow: hidden;
  text-overflow: ellipsis;
  white-space: nowrap
}
```

Tailwind has a great developer experience (DX), but the DX doesn't come without
a cost (large CSS files). For this, I use
[PurgeCSS](https://github.com/FullHuman/purgecss) and
[cssnano](https://cssnano.co/) to help reduce the size of my CSS. I also use
[autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) because Tailwind CSS
doesn't do that automatically. All of this stuff is pretty standard when using
Tailwind CSS.

## GitHub

For version control, I am using [GitHub](https://www.github.com/). Is there much
more to say? GitHub is the most popular Git platform and has the most community.
Overall GitHub is a solid platform to version control the site (and act as a
CMS).

## Netlify

Another company that offers a great DX is [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/),
and that's why I am using them to host Skies. Netlify integrates well with
GitHub. With little setup, I set up CD to trigger a new build of the site
whenever I push a new commit to the `master` branch. This makes it really easy
to hot-fix bugs and push new features. Netlify also makes it easy to enable an
SSL/TLS certificate so visitors on my site feel secure. Super cool stuff.

## Notable Libraries

Here are some other notable npm packages I'm using to help drive the site.

- [js-search](https://github.com/bvaughn/js-search): This is the client-side
  search library I'm using to search for blogs on the home page.
- [react-icons](https://github.com/react-icons/react-icons): This package lets
  me easily use icons from popular icon libraries as React components.
- [react-helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet): I use this library to
  modify the `<head>` of my document and get that
  [awesome SEO juice](/blog/awesome-links).

There's more that are not mentioned so feel free to dig into the
[`package.json`](https://github.com/swkeever/skies.dev/blob/master/package.json)
if you wish to see what other libraries I'm using.

## Future Plans

I've thought about possibly adding a more complex backend to the site to add
more sophisticated features. For now, I like the simplicity of keeping Skies as
a [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) application, writing my content in Markdown
(MDX), and having commits pushed to `master` automatically trigger a build on
Netlify.
