## Context

[Microservices](https://microservices.io/) refer to a type of software
architecture where the application is decomposed into many smaller applications
that each focus on a single business domain. These services usually have their
own database, their own server running the service, their own metrics, etc. This
way, the services are decoupled from each other and engineering teams can be
autonomous developing and specializing in one business domain.

Microservices are a popular architecture for applications that need to scale for
huge numbers of users. Companies like Amazon, Netflix, and
[many others](https://microservices.io/articles/whoisusingmicroservices.html)
are using a microservice architecture in order to handle the scale that their
business demands. When successful tech companies utilize microservices for their
business, it's tempting to think your company should adopt a microservice
architecture as well. You might be thinking, _"microservices are working well
for major tech companies, so surely microservices are a good architecture for my
company."_

Maybe. Maybe not. It depends on the scale of your company, how many users you
need to service, and how much engineering effort you can invest. In the rest of
this article, I will explain when I think you should avoid using microservices
and when you should adopt them.

If you are an early-stage startup (e.g. have not received funding) and you are
still building an MVP, then you may want to develop your application as a
monolith instead. By nature, microservices are distributed systems, and
distributed systems can be extremely complex to reason about, configure, and
manage. When adopting a microservice architecture, you will have to think about
the following:

- **Business logic**— To interact with different features, services must
  interact using interprocess communication (IPC) protocols such as REST or
  gRPC. You'll need to set up
  [service discovery](https://microservices.io/patterns/server-side-discovery.html)
  so your services can know how to communicate with each other over the network.
- **Transactions**— You need to figure out a story for managing transactions
  across multiple services that each have their own database. You can use the
  [Saga pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html) but cannot
  guarantee ACID transactions for transactions that span across multiple
  services.
- **Infrastructure**— For each service, you'll need to configure and manage
  infrastructure such as a local database, compute, metrics, etc.

On the other hand, a monolithic application has its code in one place. When
you're able to count the number of people developing the application on one
hand, I think you'll find it much easier to reason about a monolithic
architecture. In contrast with microservices, when adopting a monolithic
architecture, you'll need to think about the following:

- **Business logic**— Interacting with different features can mostly happen
  locally within the scope of the application via method calls.
- **Transactions**— You can provision a single ACID-compliant database to handle
  transactions if that's what your application needs.
- **Infrastructure**— You only need to provision infrastructure for a single
  monolith application.

I don't know about you, but I think the monolithic approach sounds easier. When
you are an early-stage startup, you usually have a small team working on your
application. You probably want to iterate fast so that you can get to market
quickly. Adopting a microservice architecture too soon can lead to spending too
much time optimizing for the _chance_ that your application needs to scale.

My suggestion for your early-stage startup is to work fast. Don't worry about
trying to overoptimize everything from the beginning. You should be working on
getting a product in the hands of your users and investors. Once your company
has funding, a larger engineering team, and many users, _then_ you should
probably think about migrating your monolith into microservices.

## When to Use Microservices

Let's say your company gets funding, your applications has many users, and you
have grown your engineering team substantially. This is the time you may want to
seriously consider converting your monolith into microservices.

This does not mean you need to completely rewrite your application from scratch
in order to adopt a microservice architecture.

Write new features as services so that the size of the monolith application
remains static. In doing so, you create a
[Strangler application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/strangler)
to help transition into the new architecture. Over time, engineering effort can
break apart the monolith into microservices, little by little, until the
monolith is no more. Then, your company can reap all the benefits of a
loosely-coupled microservice architecture.

## Summary

Microservices are great for splitting your application into modular application
services that engineering teams can develop autonomously. The problem with
microservices is they are naturally more complex to manage. For early-stage
startups building an MVP, adopting a microservice architecture could slow down
development, and a monolithic architecture would probably help you get to market
faster.
