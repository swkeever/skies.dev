## Context

Create React App, Gatsby.js, and Next.js are frameworks for writing web
applications in React.js. With so many ways to build React apps, it can be
confusing to know which framework to choose for building your web app. In this
article, I describe what each framework excels at and when you might choose one
framework over another based on different circumstances.

## Create React App

[Create React App (CRA)](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) is a
script that quickly spins up a React project and lets you start coding right
away.

The great thing about CRA is that it is dead simple to set up. There is
basically no configuration to get up and running. This lets you focus on coding
your app right away, instead of worrying about configuration files.

I would recommend using CRA for projects where
[SEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) is not a
requirement. If you view page source on an app built in CRA, you will see a
`<script>` tag that links the React application, and that's about it. Web
crawlers parse HTML to extract information about the web page, so if all it sees
is that it loads some JavaScript, then the crawler does not get as much context
about what your site is about, making it harder for your page to show up in
search results.

Assuming SEO is not a priority, CRA is just so easy to get up and running and
has a great developer experience, so it could be a great option. However, if you
want to build a site that is easier for web crawlers to index your webpage, then
you might want to look at either Gatsby or Next.

## Gatsby.js

[Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is a static site generator for your React
app. This means when a web crawler is looking at your website, it can see all
the HTML produced by your React (JavaScript) code. With this, the crawler can
better understand your webpage which can help your page rank higher in search
results.

Gatsby also has a huge array of [plugins](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/plugins/)
that make a lot of things about making a website easy and convenient. For
example, there are plugins for generating a sitemap, lazy-loading images,
accessing the filesystem, and so much more. Gatsby also has a great community
and ecosystem of people working to continuously improve it.

One of the core features of Gatsby is that it uses
[GraphQL](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/graphql/) to integrate Gatsby plugins
and data-fetching. For example, if you are using the
[gatsby-image](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-image/) plugin, you
would need to go through the GraphQL data layer to fetch `example.jpg`.

```javascript
import { useStaticQuery, graphql } from 'gatsby';
import Img from 'gatsby-image';

// fetching hello.jpg from GraphQL data layer
export default function HelloImage() {
  const data = useStaticQuery(graphql`
    query {
      file(relativePath: { eq: "example.jpg" }) {
        childImageSharp {
          fluid(maxWidth: 500) {
            ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `);

  return <Img fluid={data.file.childImageSharp.fluid} alt="hello!" />;
}
```

I recommend using Gatsby when you need your site to be SEO friendly and
performant. Gatsby's rich plugin ecosystem makes building fast sites easy. If
the content on your site is static and can be updated at build-time, then Gatsby
is a great choice.

If your app is more dynamic and requires dynamic data on each page request, then
you may want to look at Next.js, which offers out of the box server-side
rendering.

## Next.js

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org) is a framework that lets you choose to statically
generate or server-side render any web page of your site. With server-side
rendering, your JavaScript code is hydrated on the fly, instead of at build
time. This is great for dynamic pages like a logged-in user's news feed. In
these situations, your app would need to fetch data unique to that user to serve
personalized content on-demand.

For content that doesn't change often, like your marketing pages, documentation,
etc, Next gives you the option to statically generate pages. There are
performance benefits to statically generate pages compared to server-side
rendering pages so having this option is quite nice.

With Next, you are getting the best of both worlds with statically generated
pages as well as server-side rendered pages, making Next a great option for web
apps.

    <strong>It seems like Next does everything Gatsby does and more.</strong>{' '}
    Not exactly, Gatsby's plugin ecosystem alone is enough to still consider
    Gatsby over Next in certain situations. I will write about my favorite
    Gatsby plugins in a future post.

## Other options

If you need to customize the low-level configuration of your app, you may want
to create your own toolchain using a tool like
[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). I probably wouldn't recommend going this
route if you're a smaller team and need to focus on building and shipping your
product. Going this route will require you to spend more time figuring out your
own solutions for static generation, server-side rendering, and turn-key
configuration the frameworks provide you.

But if you have a large team of engineers and your app is operating at a scale
that demands this customization, then going this route may be the best option.

## Conclusion

- Choose CRA for the easiest setup and development experience. A great option
  when SEO is not a priority.
- Choose Gatsby if the content on your site is static and updates can happen at
  build time. Gatsby is a great option for blogs, documentation, and marking
  sites.
- Choose Next if you want to build a web app with dynamic content. Next is a
  great option for apps with news feeds, analytics dashboards, and otherwise
  dynamic data.
