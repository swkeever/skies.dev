wrote for my application to the
[computer science and engineering department](https://cs.uw.edu) at UW.

## Essay

When I was twelve years old, I fell in love with teaching myself musical
instruments. Using the Internet, I was able to teach myself how to play guitar,
piano, and drums; the hobby evolved into learning software that would allow me
to take my craft to the next level. I spent hours on end producing hundreds of
songs, making music videos, and continuing to educate myself via my computer. I
began to see computers as a tool that allowed people to accomplish tasks
efficiently. Learning to develop software would allow me to produce applications
that people could use to enrich their lives—similar to how software has enriched
mine. Throughout my personal and academic journey, I have learned to be
adaptable, collaborative, and an effective communicator. Studying Computer
Engineering at the University of Washington would allow me to build upon my
strengths and develop the skills necessary to create, understand, and deploy
meaningful software solutions.

I believe that being a computer engineer requires being adaptable to constantly
changing environments. After high school, I moved out of my mom’s house in
Atlanta to live on my own for the first time in New Orleans. There I met my
girlfriend, a Seattle native, as she was finishing up college. After she
graduated, we moved to Washington together where I went on to become the
caretaker on her family’s farm. Moving to a farm required that I quickly learn
how to care for goats, horses, and chickens, as well as muck stalls, build
paddocks, and maintain pastures. I had to be able to adapt quickly in order to
be successful in this new role. My time on the farm was an invaluable learning
experience for understanding the importance of adaptability, and the experience
allowed me to feel confident in my ability to succeed in new and ambiguous
situations I may face in my future career.

I have also found that communication and teamwork skills are paramount in order
to effectively solve problems and improve on inefficiencies. While I was
attending Everett Community College, I was surprised when I found out the
student fitness center lacked rowing machines. Being a rower myself, and
recognizing the prevalence of rowers in Washington, I thought students could
benefit from having access to indoor rowing machines. I took the initiative to
team up with a member of student government to create a proposal that would
argue for the purchase of the machines. We gave our presentation to the student
council and received a nearly unanimous vote in favor of purchasing two indoor
rowers for the college’s fitness center. Being able to work on teams and
communicate ideas are indispensable skills for an engineer, and this experience
deepened my understanding of their importance.

After moving to the city of Seattle, I transferred to Seattle Central where I
took my first computer science class. I found myself going above and beyond on
assignments. I was having a blast creating and turning my own design ideas into
something tangible. To me, computer programming feels like the intersection of
creative writing and logical reasoning. By programming a computer I am able to
put an idea into action, putting pieces of a puzzle together until I can bring
the idea to fruition. Furthermore, it is immensely satisfying to solve a
difficult programming problem or to discover a more elegant solution. I see
programming as an art, and everyday I strive to improve my craft by learning
ways to write more efficient, robust, and intelligible code.

Being at the University of Washington will allow me to engage in a community of
some of the brightest students and faculty in the field. Building relationships
with passionate, like-minded individuals will play an integral role in my
development as an engineer. During my time at the UW, I will emphasize my
studies in systems development in order to learn how to think critically when
developing software from the ground up. Further, the curriculum at UW offers a
well-rounded set of requirements while still giving me the flexibility to
explore all the topics I aim to learn as an undergrad. By Autumn 2018, I will
have completed 90 credits of graduation requirements and will be fully prepared
to enter the Computer Engineering major as a Junior. I am certain the UW would
make a lasting impact on my life as an engineer and as an individual. My
sincerest hope is to have the opportunity to maximize my strengths and reach my
potential developing software people could use to enrich their lives for many
years to come.

## Some advice to leave you with

I recommend taking a lot of care when writing your personal statement. I did a
complete rewrite before settling on the essay I used. I had people look over my
essay and give me feedback. I listened to narrations of my essay using an
[online reader](https://www.naturalreaders.com/online/) to get a sense of how
sentences flowed. All of this may be overkill and your mileage may vary. Just
make sure you convey to the reader that you _really_ want to study in that
major.
