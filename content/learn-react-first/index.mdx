## Learn React First

First off, realize this is an _unpopular opinion_.

The _popular opinion_ would be to say:

> You should focus on learning the fundamentalsâ€”HTML, CSS, and vanilla
> JavaScriptâ€”before trying to pick up something like React.

While there is nothing wrong with learning the fundamentals first per se, I
believe if your goal is to get up and running _as quickly as possible_, I think
you should **learn React first**.

Why?

By learning React, you are learning HTML and JavaScript in one fell swoop.

**JSX** is React's way of templating UI components. By learning JSX, you are
also effectively learning HTML because the syntax is almost identical.

```jsx
function Title() {
  return <h1>This h1 tag looks a lot like HTML!</h1>;
}
```

Also, React _is_ JavaScript. So by learning React, you are _also_ learning plain
ol' JavaScript.

```jsx
// This function is regular JavaScript syntax
function Title() {
  return <h1>By learning React, you are also learning JavaScript!</h1>;
}
```

A lot of developers are turning to React for complex UI development. By learning
React first, I think you'll be able to start building interesting projects
sooner.

Keep in mind, _there's nothing wrong with learning the fundamentals
first_â€”especially if it makes more sense to _you_.

In my experience, I tried learning the fundamentals firstâ€”but I didn't feel like
things were clicking until I started using React.

Remember, you can always go back and learn traditional web development patterns
as needed.

## What About Vue, Angular, etc?

I chose React over the other frameworks for 3 reasons.

- **Community**â€”React is
  [the most popular](https://blog.logrocket.com/state-of-javascript-what-are-the-most-in-demand-frontend-frameworks-in-2020/)
  of the frontend frameworks. This means it will be easier to find help online
  when you are stuck.
- **Ecosystem**â€”As a result of being hugely popular, there is a large of
  ecosystem of libraries and tooling to help you in development.
- **Hirability**â€”React is an
  [in-demand skillset](https://binaryinformatics.com/front-end-frameworks-2020/)
  to have if your goal is to become a frontend web developer.

## What About CSS?

React makes no opinions about how you should approach writing CSSâ€”so I'll offer
my own. If you want to learn CSS as fast as possible, consider learning
**Tailwind CSS**. I wrote more about this in another
[blog post](/blog/learn-css).

Also, when you're just starting out, you may find it helpful to use higher-level
CSS frameworks such as:

- [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)
- [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/)
- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)

Once you feel comfortable enough with React, I think you will find having some
lower-level control from a framework like Tailwind is beneficial. I wrote more
about choosing a CSS strategy with React projects in another
[blog post](/blog/react-css).

## How to Learn React

So where do you get started learning React?

I recommend taking the [Full Stack Open 2020](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)
course offered by the University of Helsinki. This is a **free online boot
camp** that lets you **go at your own pace**. They cover topics such as

- React
- NodeJS
- GraphQL

and more. Once you're comfortable with the material in the course, the idea is
that you should be ready to apply for entry-level web developer jobs.

If you are completely new to development, then make sure to take your time in
part 0 of the course. In part 0, they do cover some of the basics of web
development.

At any time taking the course, if you feel you need additional explanations,
check out [Brad Traversy](https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb) on YouTubeâ€”he
has a ton of beginner-friendly videos that should help you fill any gaps.

Good luck on your journey learning web development! Let me know on
