## Learn React First

First off, realize this is an _unpopular opinion_.

The _popular opinion_ would be to say:

> You should focus on learning the fundamentalsâ€”HTML, CSS, and vanilla
> JavaScriptâ€”before trying to pick up something like React.

I disagree.

While there is nothing wrong with learning the fundamentals first per se, I
believe if your goal is to get up and running _as quickly as possible_, I think
you should **learn React first**.

Why?

By learning React, you are learning HTML and JavaScript in one fell swoop.

With React, you are learning:

- HTML by writing [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html).
- JavaScript by writing React.

JSX is React's way of **templating** UI components.

By learning JSX, you are also effectively learning HTML because the syntax is
almost identical.

```jsx
function Title() {
  return <h1>This h1 tag looks a lot like HTML!</h1>;
}
```

Also, React _is_ JavaScript. So by learning React, you are _also_ learning plain
ol' JavaScript.

```jsx
// This function is regular JavaScript syntax
function Title() {
  return <h1>By learning React, you are also learning JavaScript!</h1>;
}
```

A lot of developers are turning to React for complex UI development. By learning
React first, I think you'll be able to start building interesting projects
sooner.

Keep in mind, _there's nothing wrong with learning the fundamentals
first_â€”especially if it makes more sense to _you_.

In my experience, I tried learning the fundamentals firstâ€”but I didn't feel like
things were clicking until I started using React.

Remember, you can always go back and learn traditional web development patterns
as needed.

## How to Learn CSS

So what about CSS?

React makes no opinions about how you should approach writing CSSâ€”so I'll offer
my own. If you want to learn CSS as fast as possible, consider learning
**Tailwind CSS**. I wrote more about this in another
[blog post](/blog/learn-css).

## How to Learn React

So where do you get started learning React?

I recommend taking the [Full Stack Open 2020](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)
course offered by the University of Helsinki. This is a **free online boot
camp** that lets you **go at your own pace**. They cover topics such as

- React
- NodeJS
- GraphQL

and more. Once you're comfortable with the material in the course, the idea is
that you should be ready to apply for entry-level web developer jobs.

If you are completely new to development, then make sure to take your time in
part 0 of the course. In part 0, they do cover some of the basics of web
development.

At any time taking the course, if you feel you need additional explanations,
check out [Brad Traversy](https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb) on YouTubeâ€”he
has a ton of beginner-friendly videos that should help you fill any gaps.

Good luck on your journey learning web development! Let me know on
