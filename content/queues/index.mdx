## What is a Queue?

A **queue** is an array-like data structure where elements are ordered
**first-in, first-out (FIFO)**. There are two basic operations in a queue.

- **enqueue**: insert an element in the _back_ of the queue.
- **dequeue**: remove the element that has been in the queue _longest_.

I want to convince you that you've probably known about queues for a long time.

## Queues in the Real World

![produce section of grocery store](grocery.jpg)

Let's say you're going grocery shopping. You've picked all of your items and
you're ready to check out so you head to the cashiers. What do you see?

You see a _queue_ of people waiting to buy their groceries.

<aside><p>In the U.S., we often refer to a queue as a <em>line</em>.</p></aside>

Now, what do you do? You probably don't skip to the front of the queue or skip
to somewhere in the middle. That would probably make people waiting upset. You
go to the back of the queue.

Who gets service from the cashier next? The person who has been _waiting the
longest_. The _next person in line_. This is exactly **first in, first out**.
Moreover, this is exactly how the queue data structure operates. A queue is a
list data structure where elements are removed in the order they were inserted.

## Practice with Queues

I hope you now have a mental model for what queues are. Now let's check your
understanding. First, I will give an example in **pseudocode** to show you how a
queue behaves.

<aside><p><strong>Pseudocode</strong> refers to high-level code that is not associated with any programming language. It's used to give an understanding of how the code works without being detailed about specific syntax.</p></aside>

### Example

```python
# first we will define a queue
queue = []

# queue = [1]
queue.enqueue(1)

# queue = [1, 2]
queue.enqueue(2)

# queue = [1, 2, 3]
queue.enqueue(3)

# x = 1, queue = [2, 3]
x = queue.dequeue()

# y = 2, queue = [3]
y = queue.dequeue()

# z = 3, queue = []
z = queue.dequeue()
```

### Practice

Now, it's your turn. What are the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` after the
following program runs?

```python
queue = []

queue.enqueue(3)
queue.enqueue(2)
queue.dequeue()
queue.enqueue(1)

# x = ???
x = queue.dequeue()

queue.enqueue(x)
queue.enqueue(1)

# y = ???
y = queue.dequeue()

# Note, the result of queue.dequeue()
#       is the value passed in as an
#       argument to queue.enqueue()
queue.enqueue(queue.dequeue())

# z = ???
z = queue.dequeue()
```

Let me know what you get!
