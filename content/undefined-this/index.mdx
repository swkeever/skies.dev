## Context

Suppose we have an `Adder` classes that can take an array of numbers and add each number by `x`.

```typescript
class Adder {
  private readonly x: number

  constructor(x: number) {
    this.x = x
  }

  addAll(ns: number[]) {
    return ns.map(this.add)
  }

  private add(n: number) {
    return this.x + n
  }
}
```

## Problem

When we run this code, we get an error that `this` is undefined.

```typescript
new Adder(2).addAll([1, 2, 3]) 
// Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'x' of undefined
```

Why is this? I think it's because when we pass the function directly into `map`, we are
getting a reference to the method belonging to the class, not the method belonging to the _class instantiation_.

## Solution

Luckily, the fix is simple: wrap your function in a higher order function.

```typescript
class Adder {
  // ...

  addAll(ns: number[]) {
    return ns.map((n) => this.add(n)) // highlight-line
  }

  // ...
}
```

Now when we run our sample client, `this` is defined in the private helper method and we don't get the error.

```typescript
new Adder(2).addAll([1, 2, 3]) 
// [3, 4, 5]
```

Hopefully this helps you save some time debugging.
