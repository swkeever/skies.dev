For picking a database, there are 2 primary options:

- SQL for storing relational dataâ€”the way people have been doing databases over
  the past 4 decades.
- NoSQL for storing non-relational (ðŸ¤¯) data, often in JSON format like MongoDB,
  DynamoDB, etc.

Personally, **I would choose a SQL database if I'm building an app from
scratch.** The flat structure of a relational database makes it easy to extend
your schema over time as you add new features.

Structuring your data in SQL database gives you the ability to use the powerful
SQL query language to retrieve the data from your database. talk about using the
database to handle search and other business logic in the mvp app.

Also, it's important to realize that a SQL database such as MySQL or ProsgreSQL
are highly-optimized engines designed to efficiently wrangle your data. However,
when using a NoSQL database, you usually have to do work on the server if you
want to do things like table joins.

However, that's not to say NoSQL databases don't have their purpose. For systems
at scale, NoSQL databases are optimized for online transaction processing
(OLTP). This means these systems are designed to handle high throughput, usually
at the expense of high consistency (the C from
[ACID](<https://database.guide/what-is-acid-in-databases/#:~:text=In%20database%20systems%2C%20ACID%20(Atomicity,occur%20while%20processing%20a%20transaction.)>).

For companies that utilize a microservice architecture, I think it makes a lot
of sense to use NoSQL databases. Assuming your company is following
[domain-driven design](https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215),
each service that needs to store data could have a NoSQL table such as DynamoDB
to store business domain model. Assuming a REST API, you could store the data in
a way that closely maps to the JSON you respond with. This leaves virtually no
work for the server in terms of data transformation giving more room for higher
throughput.

Complex microservice architectures often need to join data from sources that
are over the network, utilizing patterns such as
[CQRS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/cqrs). This
makes the advanced querying features of a SQL database less practical. At scale,
I think the SQL databases are best left to analytics and data platform teams
that can afford wait times to perform
