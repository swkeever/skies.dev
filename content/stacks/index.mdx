## What is a Stack?

A stack is an array of elements stored in **last in, first out (LIFO)** order.
There are two fundamental operations you can do on a stack:

- When you **push** an item on a stack, it means you insert an item.
- When you **pop** an item off the stack, it means you remove the _last inserted
  item_ from the stack.

That's basically all there is to it.

## Stacks in the Real World

Imagine you're at Chipotle getting a burrito.

The line makes your burrito and you get to the cashier who says, "Would you like
your burrito for here or to go?"

You reply, "For here."

The cashier grabs a tray from _the top of a stack of trays_ and puts your
burrito inside. Notice, the cashier didn't pick up half of the trays and give
you one from the middle. She also didn't turn the trays over and give you one
off the bottom. She gave you the tray that was on top.

This is exactly how stacks in computer science behave. When you remove an item
from a stack, the item comes off the top. We say the item is **popped** off the
stack. When you **pop** an item off a stack, it means you remove the last
element you inserted.

### Don't forget to push your tray

After eating your burrito, you look around the restaurant to find where to put
your tray. You see a stack of trays by the compost bin.

You walk over and put your tray _on top of the stack of trays_. Again notice,
you didn't pick up half of the trays and stick your tray in the middle. You
didn't turn the trays over and put your tray at the bottom. You put your tray on
the top of the stack.

This is how a stack behaves in computer science as well. When you put an item on
the stack, the item is placed on top of the stack. We say the item is **pushed**
on the stack. When you **push** an item on a stack, it means you put an element
on the top of the stack.

## Thank you, come again

In summary, when you **push** an element onto the stack, that element goes on
top of the stack. When you **pop** an element off the stack, that element comes
off the top of the stack.

You will commonly hear that a stack is a **LIFO data structure**. This means
that elements are ordered **last in, first out**. Below is a simple JavaScript
program that shows this behavior.

```javascript
const stack = [];

// push 1, 2, 3 on the stack
stack.push(1); // [1]
stack.push(2); // [1, 2]
stack.push(3); // [1, 2, 3]

// pop all the elements off the stack
const x = stack.pop(); // x = 3, stack = [1, 2]
const y = stack.pop(); // y = 2, stack = [1]
const z = stack.pop(); // z = 1, stack = []
```

Now it's your turn. I'll write a program. Can you tell me what the values of
`x`, `y`, and `z` are? Let me know on Twitter! üëç

```javascript
const stack = [3, 2, 1];
const x = stack.pop(); // x = ???
stack.push(4);
stack.push(5);
stack.pop();
stack.pop();
const y = stack.pop(); // y = ???
stack.pop();
stack.push(6);
const y = stack.pop(); // z = ???
```
