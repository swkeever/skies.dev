## Context

In this article, I'm going to show you how I use TypeScript to improve Google
Analytics events tracking. The beauty of using TypeScript is we can use the
`enum` type to create discrete options to choose from. This should help us make
our analytics more consistent as we'll see in this article.

The examples we'll look at involve the Gatsby framework, but I'm going to try and
make it so you can learn this pattern no matter how you're building your site.

Learning how to use Google Analytics or Gatsby is beyond the scope of this
article. For a general tutorial on setting up Google Analytics with Gatsby,

## A Note on Privacy

Before adding analytics tracking to your site, make sure you understand your
country's privacy laws for collecting analytics on your site. You may want to
consider configuring Google Analytics to anonymize the IP address of your users
and also respect the "Do Not Track" flag.

```javascript
// gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: 'gatsby-plugin-google-analytics',
      options: {
        trackingId: 'UA-123456789-1',
        // highlight-start
        anonymize: true,
        respectDNT: true,
        // highlight-end
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

I'm not an expert on web privacy laws, so I recommend consulting with someone
who is if you have questions about collecting analytics.

## Event Tracking with TypeScript

There are three main properties we want to set when tracking an
[event](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033068?hl=en).

These are how I think of each event property.

- **Category**. What type of thing was interacted with?
- **Action**. How was the thing interacted with?
- **Label**. Which specific thing was interacted with?

In my project, I create an `analytics.ts` to store information about event
tracking.

I like to use the TypeScript `enum` for each event property. This lets me have
discrete properties that I can use throughout my site. I find this approach more
maintainable than using ad-hoc strings.

```typescript
// ‚ùå Bad
// Ad-hoc strings could lead to inconsistencies in analytics bucketing
trackCustomEvent({
  category: 'Newsletter',
  action: 'Subscribe',
});

// ‚úÖ Good
// Discrete options to choose makes bucketing analytics more maintainable
trackCustomEvent({
  category: AnalyticsCategory.Newsletter,
  action: AnalyticsAction.Subscribe,
});
```

I define the following `enum` types to give me a discrete set of options that I
can use throughout my site. With these types, I can create my own custom
`AnalyticsEvent` interface to model an event.

```typescript
// analytics.ts
export enum AnalyticsCategory {
  Themes = 'Themes',
  Newsletter = 'Newsletter',
  Blogs = 'Blogs',
  Feedback = 'Feedback',
  Contact = 'Contact',
}

export enum AnalyticsAction {
  Click = 'Click',
  Subscribe = 'Subscribe',
  Switch = 'Switch',
  SendEmail = 'Send Email',
  Like = 'Liked',
  Dislike = 'Dislike',
  Dismiss = 'Dismiss',
}

export enum AnalyticsLabel {
  Light = 'Light',
  Dark = 'Dark',
  Green = 'Green',
  Blue = 'Blue',
  Red = 'Red',
}

export interface AnalyticsEvent {
  category: AnalyticsCategory;
  action: AnalyticsAction;
  label?: AnalyticsLabel | string;
}
```

I let the `label` property also accept a `string` because sometimes I need to
label something dynamically.

For example, here I let the label be the page the user was on when they
interacted with some `Button` component.

```tsx
import { useLocation } from '@reach/router';
import { trackCustomEvent } from 'gatsby-plugin-google-analytics';
import {
  AnalyticsAction,
  AnalyticsCategory,
  AnalyticsEvent,
} from '@utils/analytics';

function Button() {
  const { pathname } = useLocation(); // highlight-line
  return (
    <button
      type="button"
      onClick={() => {
        trackCustomEvent({
          category: AnalayticsCategory.Feedback,
          action: AnalyticsAction.SentEmail,
          label: pathname, // highlight-line
        });
      }}
    >
      Click
    </button>
  );
}
```

I also create a thin wrapper over the `trackCustomEvent` function exported by
`gatsby-plugin-google-analytics`.

The plugin supports TypeScript, but it doesn't support the custom
`AnalyticsEvent` interface that I defined.

Making this wrapper lets me use my `AnalyticsEvent` type instead of the
`CustomEventArgs` interface that is exported by
`gatsby-plugin-google-analytics`.

```typescript
// analytics.ts
import { trackCustomEvent } from 'gatsby-plugin-google-analytics'; // highlight-line

// ‚úÇÔ∏è Unchanged..

// highlight-start
// Thin wrapper to get TypeScript support
export function track(event: AnalyticsEvent) {
  trackCustomEvent(event);
}
// highlight-end
```

With that change, we can refactor our `Button` component ever so slightly.

```tsx
import { useLocation } from '@reach/router';
import {
  AnalyticsAction,
  AnalyticsCategory,
  AnalyticsEvent,
  track,
} from '@utils/analytics';

function Button() {
  const { pathname } = useLocation();
  return (
    <button
      type="button"
      onClick={() => {
        // highlight-start
        const event: AnalyticsEvent = {
          category: AnalayticsCategory.Feedback,
          action: AnalyticsAction.SentEmail,
          label: pathname,
        };
        track(event);
        // highlight-end
      }}
    >
      Click
    </button>
  );
}
```

That's all there is to it. TypeScript makes it easy to choose from a selection
of discrete event types. I like this approach because it makes your analytics
more consistent and helps you collect better data on how users are interacting
with your site.
