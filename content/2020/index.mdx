2020 was definitely a year packed full of twists and turns. I don't need to (nor would you want me to) go on and on reviewing all the events that took place during this year. Instead, I want to take some time to reflect on my own experience this 2020, because it certainly wasn't all doom and gloom. I'm fortunate and grateful for that.

Let's go back to when it was considered normal to eat out at restaurants.

## Winter 2020

Ah, yes. Winter 2020 in the USA. Before the pandemic. Before the masks. 

I remember Mary was with her family in Hawaii at the time I first heard about the coronavirus. They told me the virus landed in Everett, WA, not too far north of Seattle. For the next couple of months, people seemed to generally be aware of the virus we weren't all wearing masks yet.

The only thing on my mind at the time was just finishing up these last two quarters and [getting my degree](/free-college). I had accepted my return offer from my internship to work at OfferUp. So in early 2020, it was just about grinding through these last two quarters, which I was generally pretty excited about, because I like learning about computer science.

### First time being a TA

During Winter quarter, I was a TA for the first time for [CSE 451: Operating Systems](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse451/20wi/). This is a course about how operating systems work. Our instructor [Gary Kimura](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gary-kimura-4aa4689/) described the course as "drinking from a firehouse." Even though this was my second lap learning the material for this course as a TA, it felt no different for me.

I'm glad I had the opportunity to TA a course during my time at UW. Our instruction team consisted of 2 Microsoft veterans, Gary Kimura and Mark Zibikowski, who did a lot of the early work on Windows file systems. We also had a group of 4 TAs, including me. One of our TAs, Jialin, was a PhD candidate doing operating systems research. It was valuable having her on our team. She had a great breadth of knowledge about the theory of operating systems and she built the labs so she knew about all the little nooks and crannies of the software. The undergrad TAs including myself, would often lean on Jialin to help us understand concepts we didn't understand.

Office hours most of the time was helping other students with their labs. Debugging other students software was challenging to do. But I think it's a useful skill to have as a software engineer as giving code reviews is a common part of a software engineer's job.

Leading a section was interesting too. When I took the OS course as a student, I thought the sections were useful because the sections would discuss the lab assignments in detail which would help us in completing the labs. I wanted the sections I gave to be no different. To make this possible, I needed to review the material prior to teaching the section so that I could at least pretend like I knew what I was talking about. All in all, teaching the section was good practice with learning how to speak in front of people, how to read a room, and how to make sure the most amount of people come out of it feeling like their time was well spent. 

Towards the end of the quarter, masks started to become more common. The last week or so, they cancelled classes and they also cancelled finals. A welcome suprise. 

### Relaxing in the San Juans Islands

After the quarter ended, Mary and I stayed at an AirBnb in Friday Harbor, San Juan Islands. We really enjoy how chill it is on the San Juans. The day we were on the ferry back to the mainland, they were not allowing new visitors on the island. We came right on time.

## Spring 2020

I didn't apply to be a TA for another quarter, I decided to instead challenge myself in my last quarter with a challenging courseload. I decided to take 4 CSE courses so that I could've taken all the CSE courses I wanted to take while at UW.

Since Spring 2020 would be completely remote, I was actually able to utilize my time in such a way that doing 4 courses concurrently was more managable. For example, the teaching material for my [course on programming languages](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages) is available online, which allowed me to watch the videos at 2x speed and finish all the homeworks in the first 2 weeks of the quarter. This was helpful since I knew I was going to need the extra time for the other classes, like Algorithms.

### Improving my grade with Office Hours

[My course on Algorithms](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse421/20sp/) is one that focuses heavily on proofs. We learned about things like graphs, dynamic programming, min flow, max cut, etc. Although the material was interesting enough, I found myself doing extremely poorly on all the homework assignments. 

After I found out how far I was below the mean after the midterm, I knew I had to make adjustments. I set up a Zoom call with the instructor to explain my situation.

He asked if I was going to office hours. I replied, "No".

He said, "Oh yeah, you should be going to office hours. I basically give the students the answers there."

Is he serious?  My mind was blown. ü§Ø

I took him up on his suggestion. I started attending the office hours, and sure enough, I started receiving the solutions for the homework assignments, which helped improve my grade in the class.

### Virtual graduation

After [working my ass off](/free-college) for the past 5 or so years, I finally graduated from college. The pandemic was in full-swing so the graduation ceremony was all virtual. Mary's family came over to the apartment and we had chicken wings and oderves. 

It was nice.

 In addition to having Mary's family over, we got my family on the east coast on Zoom and we played Family Fued together. 
 
 The Keever's vs the Osetinsky's. I was your man, Steve Harvey. 

Another kind of funny part of the graduation ceremony was when they were showing the reel of graduates. I remember sitting there and being like, "Oh Mary, come see. They're almost at the K's for the college of engineering!" We were looking intently, and then, we see L's, then M's. Wait a minute. I wasn't in the reel! üòÇ

I could only imagine the logistical headache the UW must've been going through to organize such an event remotely and on short notice, so I'm not too fussed. But it was pretty funny because we took a video to capture the moment, and I wasn't there. 

My family began to wonder if I actually did graduate.

### Started the Skies blog

Oh yeah, I also started the first iterations of this blog. It was still under the domain _swkeever.github.io_ at the time. The blog has been a nice place for me to try out different technologies. I experimented deploying this blog to various platforms like [Netlify](/tech-stack), [AWS](/aws-gatsby), and [Vercel](https://www.vercel.com). I am learning the powerful [Tailwind CSS](/tailwind-react-trick).

In the summer I bought the _skies.dev_ domain name and started building out the blog as Skies. I would work on the blog in the evenings after work. I don't know, it was kind of relaxing to just tweak the design of the site beyond what was necessary for a static blog. Over this year, I published **32 articles**.

## Summer 2020

### Joined OfferUp

After graduation, I started working at [OfferUp](https://offerup.com) as a backend engineer on the Discovery team.

My summer starting full-time work remotely focused a lot on onboarding: learning their codebase and tech stack, adjusting to work-life, etc. I'd say the transition from college-work to work-work was smooth enough. 

I was actually pretty happy that I could work remotely. When I interned at OfferUp the summer prior, I asked my manager at the time if I could work remotely because Mary and I wanted to travel to Spain.

 The manager at the time said, "It's not going to happen. We don't do remote." 
 
 It's interesting to see how then COVID hit and then _BAM_, everyone is remote. So from that perspective, it was a welcome outcome of COVID to see more tech companies are offering remote options.

So far at OfferUp, I've taken ownership in our _lists_ service. The _lists_ service is a simple service that is in charge of storing the user's saved items (like a wishlist). For example, I

- Refactored the _lists_ service so it doesn't call into the legacy monolith application‚Äîwithout breaking consumers.
- Designed, documented, and implemented new internal endpoints to be consumed by the admin client in our _lists_ service.
- Synced our cloud infrastructure into infrastructure as code using Terraform.

## Fall 2020

### First time to Hawaii

This Fall, Mary and I got engaged. We then spent 2 weeks in Maui, HI in October. It was my first time to Hawaii, and it was quite peaceful. I loved hearing the sound of the tropical birds outside in the morning. The close promixity to the beach was quite awesome. It has been a while since I've swam in warm water. Here are some of the things we did while we were in Maui:

- Road to Hana
- Climb HaleakalƒÅ volcano
- Kahekili Highway, dubbed the ‚Äúdeath highway of Maui‚Äù
- Relax on the beach üå¥

### Started building Geofyi

Mary quit her job in the summer to work on building a startup. Since college, Mary has had an interest in building a startup. We went back and forth on the kind of product that would be worth investing time and energy in. We went back and forth on this product would look like. We eventually started what is [Geofyi](https://www.geofyi.com)‚Äîa platform for people to feel closer to local communities near and far. 

We're still in the super early stages of building this product. We haven't done a major announcement or anything like that. But you can still go on the app today, sign up, and have threaded discussions in the web app.

### Got a rowing machine

Rowing is one of my favorite ways to work out. Rowing workouts are brutal, works a lot of muscle groups, and it makes you feel great afterwards. I've wanted my own rowing machine for years now.

My dad had a [Concept 2](https://www.concept2.com/) rowing machine that he wasn't using anymore, and he offered to ship it to me as a Christmas present. Although the rowing machine is way too big for the apartment we're living in now, it is so cool to finally have a rowing machine of my own. 

## Goals for 2021

Some goals I have for 2021 are

- **Become promoted to Software Engineer II** at OfferUp by Summer 2021 after helping them build out the new redesign of the search architecture.
- Continue helping Mary **build Geofyi**‚Äîiterating on new features to see what people are like and focus on growth of the app. We plan to have our first real release early next year.
- Mary and I want to utilize this unique time to **move somewhere interesting** for 2-3 months during Winter 2021. We have a few places in mind including Texas, Florida, Arizona, and maybe even Mexico. I am personally interested in any opportunity to improve my Spanish, but we would need to consider how feasible it would be with the restrictions due to COVID.
- **Marry Mary** in Summer 2021. Maybe we can go on a trip of sorts after. We're pretty low-key people so we don't need a whole lot to be happy.
- **Buy a new car.** Our dream car is a Tesla, but that is looking over-budget for now. We are thinking of getting a Subaru Crostrek as a practical option that'll get us by for a long while.
- **Find a new place to live long-term.** This will most likely be back in Seattle after moving somewhere during the winter. Not sure yet if we'll buy or just rent, but I'm still probably leaning towards renting due to how astronomical house prices are in Seattle.

I should probably think of some more goals but I think this will do for now. I hope to hit these milestones by the end of the first half of the year. I'll come back and update if I think of more.
