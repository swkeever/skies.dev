## Problem

A pain point with using a utility-first CSS framework such as Tailwind CSS is
that you inevitably end up with long strings to fit all your utility classes.

```html
<a
  href="#"
  class="w-full flex items-center justify-center px-8 py-3 border
  border-transparent text-base leading-6 font-medium rounded-md text-primaryBold
  bg-neutralBg hover:text-primary focus:outline-none
  focus:border-primaryBgSofter focus:shadow-outline-indigo transition
  duration-150 ease-in-out md:py-4 md:text-lg md:px-10"
>
  Live demo
</a>
```

In my opinion, this is approach is hard to maintain and ugly to look at. You
basically have to do an _O(n)_ linear search through each class whenever you
want to update the styles.

**In this tutorial, we are working toward a more maintainable, easy-to-read
solution to this problem.**

Consider the following:

_What are the ways we would write Tailwind CSS utility classes?_

It could be a **string** like we saw earlier.

```jsx
function Button() {
  return (
    <button className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-600 shadow-md ...">
      Click
    </button>
  );
}
```

To include JavaScript, we could write a **template literal**. With a template
literal, we can even place classes on new lines to avoid extremely long lines to
fit all the class names.

```jsx
function Button({ color }) {
  return (
    <button
      className={`${whateverJavaScript(color)} 
    px-4 py-2
    bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-600
    shadow-md
    ...
    `}
    >
      Click
    </button>
  );
}
```

I think we are closer to a more maintainable solution. However, the problem with
template literals is in the name itself.

_They are literal._

Formatters and linters such as Prettier and ESLint make no attempt to format the
utility classes written in template literals, leading to files with sloppy
indentation.

## Solution

The solution is inspired by code in
[tailwindlabs/tailwindui-react](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindui-react).

The solution is simply to use a **function.**

**JavaScript:**

```JavaScript
// tailwind.js
export function tw(...classes) {
  return classes.filter(Boolean).join(' ');
}
```

**TypeScript:**

```typescript
// tailwind.ts
export function tw(...classes: (false | null | undefined | string)[]): string {
  return classes.filter(Boolean).join(' ');
}
```

> We could optionally name this function `classNames` as the original author
> [Robin Malfait](https://twitter.com/malfaitrobin) did in
> [tailwindui-react](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindui-react/blob/develop/src/utils/class-names.ts).
>
> I chose `tw` to give brevity for the writer and context for the reader.

Now we can cleanly span our classes over many lines. What's more, **the
formatter can easily format our files.**

```jsx
// @components/Hero.tsx
import Logo from '@assets/logo.svg';
import tw from '@utils/tailwind';

function Hero() {
  return (
    <Logo
      className={tw(
        'relative',
        'w-full h-auto',
        'mt-2 mb-4',
        'text-blue-600 fill-current'
      )}
    />
  );
}
```

**Group together similar classes**, such as

- position
- spacing
- sizing
- color

When in doubt, group things the way Tailwind groups things on their
[website](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).

```jsx
import Logo from '@assets/logo.svg';
import tw from '@utils/tailwind';

function Hero() {
  return (
    <Logo
      className={tw(
        'absolute top-2 left-2', // position
        'mt-2 mb-4', // spacing
        'w-full h-auto', // sizing
        'text-blue-600 fill-current' // color
      )}
    />
  );
}
```

Easily include JavaScript sources.

```jsx
import Logo from '@assets/logo.svg';
import tw from '@utils/tailwind';
import globalStyles from '@styles'; // highlight-line

function Hero() {
  return (
    <Logo
      className={tw(
        'absolute top-2 left-2', // position
        'mt-2 mb-4', // spacing
        'w-full h-auto', // size
        'text-blue-600 fill-current', // color
        globalStyles.transitions // highlight-line
      )}
    />
  );
}
```

In addition, we could use a plugin like
[Headwind](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=heybourn.headwind)
to also alphabetize the classes.

> I don't care that much to have my classes alphabetized, and I've found it to
> make for a worse DX.

Hope this helps you clean up Tailwind CSS in your own React projects.
