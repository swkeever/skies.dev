## Why Start a Blog?

It's a reasonable question. What is the point of having a blog?

I can't speak for everyone, but in this article I will explain the reasons _I_
started the Skies blog. After reading, hopefully you have a better understanding
of why blogging could be beneficial.

### TL;DR

I developed the Skies blog to

- build an online presence
- have ownership over the site's content and tech
- help others learn

With that, let's jump right in!

## Online Presence


I developed the Skies blog because I wanted to build an online presence.
When you Google my name you can be taken to my blog and see what I'm up to.
Sure, I could just go to Facebook, LinkedIn, or whatever and build an online presence there.
But I like having my own site because it lets me be in control of the content that I publish
and the user experience.

## Ownership

I could post your content on any one of the other blogging platforms such as
Medium. However, developing my own site gives me a sense of control of the
content I publish. Having my own site gives me the power to customize the user
experience and make it my own.

into making the Skies blog.

## Education

I love helping people learn new things. If one of my articles can help someone
then all the better.

Writing a blog gives the opportunity to document my learnings and share them
with the world. Moreover, there is research that demonstrates teaching as a
powerful mechanism for learning. Win win.

## Summary

Writing a blog can be a great way to

- establish an online presence
- having control of my site
- help others and yourself

I hope this article has helped you formulate some of the benefits of writing a
blog. Have a nice day!
