## Why Start a Blog?

It's a reasonable question. What is the point of having a blog? I can't speak
for everyone, but in this article I will explain the reasons _I_ started the
Skies blog. Hopefully, this will give you a sense of the benefits of having a
blog.

## Online Presence

A blog can help with establishing an online presence. For example, an employer
interesting in hiring me could find my blog and get a sense of what I know, and
what I don't know. ðŸ˜‰

In addition, an online presence could lead to new opportunities and help me form
connections around the world. And yes, I don't _need_ a blog to have an online
presence since plenty of social media sites like LinkedIn and Twitter exist.

This leads into my next point.

## Ownership

I could post your content on any one of the other blogging platforms such as
Medium. However, developing my own site gives me a sense of control of the
content I publish. Having my own site gives me the power to customize the user
experience and make it my own.

into making the Skies blog.

## Education

I love helping people learn new things. If one of my articles can help someone
then all the better.

Writing a blog gives the opportunity to document my learnings and share them
with the world. Moreover, there is research that demonstrates teaching as a
powerful mechanism for learning. Win win.

## Summary

Writing a blog can be a great way to

- establish an online presence
- having control of my site
- help others and yourself

I hope this article has helped you formulate some of the benefits of writing a
blog. Have a nice day!
