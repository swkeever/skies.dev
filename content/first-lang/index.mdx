## Context

When you're just beginning to learn to program, it can be overwhelming to know
where to start. There are many programming languages to choose from. What should
be the first programming language you learn?

When you are just starting out, don't worry about learning many different
programming languages. I recommend picking _one language_ and sticking with it
at least until you feel you have reached a reasonable proficiency.

> It's better to be good at one programming language than OK at many different
> programming languages.

## Determine Your Goals

The first thing to ask yourself when beginning to learn programming is _what are
my goals?_ Different languages are better suited for different purposes. Knowing
what you want to do with programming should simplify your decision for what you
should learn.

The following table shows what language you should learn based on each goal. If
you see the type of thing you want to build listed, then I recommend learning
that corresponding programming language.

| Goal                                | Language   |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Web apps                            | JavaScript |
| iOS apps                            | Swift      |
| Android apps                        | Kotlin     |
| Video games                         | C#         |
| Video game engines                  | C++        |
| Embedded systems, operating systems | C          |
| Machine learning, data science      | Python     |

If you know you want to do programming but you aren't sure what your goals are
yet, that is perfectly normal. In this case, I believe the first programming
language you should learn is **Python**.

## Hello Python

Python is a great first language because it is simple relative to other
languages. When programmers learn a new programming language, the first program
we always write is called **Hello World**. Hello World is a program that prints
out the text "Hello World." In Python, to write a Hello World program, all we
have to do is write

```python
print('Hello World')
```

Compare this with the Hello World program written in the **Java** programming
language.

```java
class Hello {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World");
  }
}
```

Without a doubt, writing Hello World in Python is simpler because you can print
"Hello World" right away. In Java, you have to write a **class** and a
**method** before you can print "Hello World."

<aside>
  <p>
    There's nothing wrong with Java. Java is a fantastic language. In fact, Java{' '}
    <em>is</em> used as a introductory programming language in a lot of computer
    science curriculums. But I believe Python is better suited for beginners.

## Python is Popular

Another reason I think Python is a good first language is that it is a popular
language. According to a
[Stack Overflow survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-popular-technologies),
Python is the **2nd most popular programming language**.

<aside>
  <p>
    In the survey, HTML/CSS is listed 2nd most popular, SQL is listed 3rd, and
    Python is listed 4th. HTML is a{' '}
    <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >
      markup language
    </a>
    , CSS is a <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_sheet_language"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >
      style sheet language
    </a>, and SQL is a{' '}
    <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_language"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >
      query language
    </a>
    . Thus, Python is the 2nd most popular programming language.

By learning Python, you are learning a language that is
[widely-used in industry](https://stackshare.io/python). Python can be used to
do a lot of things. Just to name a few, Python can be used for

- Building web apps using the [Django framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- Data science and analytics using [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- Machine learning with [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

Don't worry about learning these frameworks and libraries just yet. I just want
to give you a taste of what Python is well-suited for. When you're just starting
out, **focus on learning the fundamentals**.

## Learn the Fundamentals

Learn how to answer the following:

- What are the common **data types**?
- What are **conditional statements**?
- What are **loops**?
- How to handle **exceptional** behavior?
- What are **functions**?
- What are **classes** and **objects**?

I personally like
[Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) for learning
Python and also for learning how to make interesting projects. If you prefer
videos, they have an accompanying
[Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/automate/?couponCode=JUL2020FREE). I
think this a fun course to get you up and running with your first programming
language.

## Your Journey Starts Now

Good luck on your path learning programming. Remember, there's _always_ going to
be things you don't know. There's so much that you could possibly learn, and
there is no way you could learn everything. Figure out what it is _you_ like
about programming and stick with that. At the end of the day, **have fun** with
it and **build cool things**.
