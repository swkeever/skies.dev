In the popular backend Node.js framework, [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), there is first-class
support for creating [middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html). 
Next.js does not have this kind of first-class support built in. There is [next-connect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-connect)
 which offers an Express-like API.

In this article, we'll look at **higher-order functions** to create middleware in Next.js API routes.

## Metrics

The first example I'll show is the simplest. I want to create a middleware that logs information
about the HTTP request.

To create the higher-order function, we need to create a function that:

1. takes as argument a handler function
2. runs some business logic
3. executes the handler function before returning 

```typescript
// lib/middleware/with-metrics.ts
import {NextApiHandler, NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse} from 'next'

const withMetrics = (handler: NextApiHandler) => {
  return async (req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) => {
    console.info('[api]', req.method, req.url)
    return handler(req, res)
  }
}

export default withMetrics
```

To see the middleware in action, we'll apply it to a simple API route: One that always sends a rocket emoji.

```typescript
// pages/api/rocket.js
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'
import withMetrics from 'lib/middleware/with-metrics.ts'

const handler = (req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) => {
  return res.status(200).send('🚀')
}

export default withMetrics(handler)
```

Now when we hit this API route, 
we will see the information about the request logged to the the server console.

## Authentication

Another practical use case for middleware is authentication.

The topic of authentication
goes deep and beyond the scope of this article. We'll create a naive authentication implementation
for demonstration. Our implementation will check that the `x-server-secret` header sent by
the client matches the server secret stored as an [environment variable](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables).

```typescript
// lib/middleware/with-metrics.ts
import {NextApiHandler, NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse} from 'next'

const withAuth = (handler: NextApiHandler) => {
  return async (req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) => {
    // highlight-start
    // Reject unauthorized clients
    if (req.headers['x-server-secret'] !== process.env.SERVER_SECRET) {
      return res.status(401).send('You did provide the secret value!')
    }
    // highlight-end

    return handler(req, res)
  }
}

export default withAuth
```

> It goes without saying you should follow a more secure practice when
adding authentication to your own app. 


We can now update `/pages/api/rockets.ts` to only accept requests from clients that send the
correct `x-server-secret` header value.

```typescript
// pages/api/rocket.js
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'
import withMetrics from 'lib/middleware/with-metrics.ts'
import withAuth from 'lib/middleware/with-auth.ts' // highlight-line

const handler = (req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) => {
  return res.status(200).send('🚀')
}

export default withMetrics(withAuth(handler)) // highlight-line
```

If this looks confusing to you—functions passing in functions passing in functions—
I was confused when I was learning it too. Try this. 
**Read each higher-order function from left to right**:

First, `withMetrics` is run (the HTTP request info is logged). 
Then, authentication (`withAuth`) is run.
If the client is authenticated, 
a `200 (OK)` is sent with a rocket emoji. 
Otherwise, a `401 (Unauthorized)` is sent.

## Validation

The third and final example we'll look at is a middleware for validating the request body in a POST request.
For schema validation, I like [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup), so we'll be using it 
along with [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) in the implementation, 
inspired by [Bruno Antunes' Yup validation middleware](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG7sLbI8kL8).

```bash
npm install yup lodash
npm install -D @types/yup
```

We'll write a function `withBody` that takes two arguments:

1. `schemas`: Yup validation schemas.
2. `handler`: The same Next.js API handler we've come to love.

```typescript
import {NextApiHandler, NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse} from 'next'
import {ObjectShape} from 'yup/lib/object'
import {has} from 'lodash'
import {ObjectSchema} from 'yup'

export type IHttpMethod = 'GET' | 'POST' | 'PUT' | 'DELETE' | 'PATCH'

export type IValidationSchemas = Partial<
  Record<IHttpMethod, ObjectSchema<ObjectShape>>
>

export function withBody(
  schemas: IValidationSchemas,
  handler: NextApiHandler,
) {
  return async (req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) => {
    if (!has(schemas, req.method)) {
      return handler(req, res)
    }

    const schema = schemas[req.method]

    if (schema == null) {
      const message = `Requires non-null validation schema to validate request body`
      console.warn(message)
      return res.status(400).send(message)
    }

    try {
      req.body = await schema.validate(req.body, {
        abortEarly: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production',
      })
      return handler(req, res)
    } catch (err) {
      const message = `Failed to validate request body: ${err.message}`
      console.warn(message)
      return res.status(400).send(message)
    }
  }
}
```

Now we'll go back to our API route and allow clients to create new
rockets, modeled by the `IRocket` interface.

```typescript
interface IRocket {
  id: number
  name: string
  org: string
}
```

We'll use Yup to define our validation schemas.

```typescript
const rocketValidationSchemas: IValidationSchemas = {
  POST: yup.object().shape({
    name: yup.string().required(),
    org: yup.string().required(),
  })
}
```

We will model the database with an array. 

```typescript
const rockets: IRocket[] = [
  {
    id: 0,
    name: 'Falcon V',
    org: 'Space X',
  },
  {
    id: 1,
    name: 'New Glenn',
    org: 'Blue Origin',
  },
  // And so on...
]
```

With these pieces, we'll add support for adding a rocket.

```typescript
// ✂️ pages/api/rocket.ts 

const handler = (req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) => {
  // highlight-start
  if (req.method === 'POST') {
    const newRocket = {
      id: rockets.length,
      ...req.body,
    }

    rockets.push(newRocket)

    return res.status(201).json(newRocket)
  }
  // highlight-end

  return res.status(200).send('🚀')
}

// highlight-start
export default withMetrics(withAuth(withBody(rocketValidationSchemas, handler)))
// highlight-end
```

Consider the execution of this API for POST requests:

1. Log info about the request
2. Authenticate the client
3. If authenticated, validate the request body 
4. If body is valid, push the new rocket to the array

You've now looked at three examples of using higher-order functions
for middleware in Next.js apps. 

> If you ever find yourself rewriting the same code in your API routes,
think about how you could reuse code in a middleware.

## Exercises

Here are some exercises to practice writing middleware.
Each exercise harder than the previous.

1. Create a middleware `withDevOnly` that sends a `403 (Forbidden)` whenever running in production.
Hint: check `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'`.
2. Create a middleware `withMethods` that takes `IHttpMethod[]` and sends `405 (Method Not Allowed)`
if the request method is not included.
3. Create a middleware `withHandlers` that takes a `Partial<Record<IHttpMethod, NextApiHandler>>`
to supply implementations for each `IHttpMethod`. If the request method does not have an implementation,
send `405 (Method Not Allowed)`.
