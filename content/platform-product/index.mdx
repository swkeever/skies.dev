## Context

What do you think about when you think of household technology companies like
Microsoft, Google, and Amazon?

- Microsoft has their operating system
- Google has their search engine
- Amazon has their marketplace.

But _what do all of these companies have in common?_ Each of these companies
provide their **platform as a service**.

- Microsoft offers Azure
- Google offers GCP
- Amazon offers AWS

Application developers need infrastructure to build and ship their products, and
these three companies are providing it. Companies acquire a dependency on these
cloud services to run their applications. The result is **win-win**. Companies
can use these cloud services to seamlessly scale up, and the cloud providers
make more money when they do.

## Bezo's Mandate

In Steve Yegge's
[rant on platforms](https://gist.github.com/chitchcock/1281611), Yegge wrote how
in 2002, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos famously issued a mandate that said something
along the lines of:

- All teams will henceforth expose their data and functionality through service
  interfaces.
- Teams must communicate with each other through these interfaces.
- There will be no other form of interprocess communication allowed: no direct
  linking, no direct reads of another team's data store, no shared-memory model,
  no back-doors whatsoever. The only communication allowed is via service
  interface calls over the network.
- It doesn't matter what technology they use. HTTP, Corba, Pubsub, custom
  protocolsâ€”doesn't matter.
- All service interfaces, without exception, must be designed from the ground up
  to be externalizable. That is to say, the team must plan and design to be able
  to expose the interface to developers in the outside world. No exceptions.
- Anyone who doesn't do this will be fired.
- Thank you; have a nice day!

Bezo's mandate birthed what has become AWS, a leading cloud provider that serves
many [big-name companies](https://www.contino.io/insights/whos-using-aws).
According to
[how Amazon makes money](https://www.investopedia.com/how-amazon-makes-money-4587523),
AWS alone brings in about _50% of Amazon's operating income_.

> **Operating income** is the profit realized from a business's operations after
> deducting operating expenses such as wages, depreciation, and cost of goods
> sold (COGS). -
> [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/operatingincome.asp)

The result of Amazon following through with Bezo's mandate undoubtedly turned
out to be fruitful for Amazon's business as well as all of the companies that
utilize its services.

## Make Your Platform a Product

The platform your company provides doesn't have to try and achieve the same
goals as AWS. **Stripe** is a company that provides an API for processing
payments. According to Forbes, the company
[now has a valuation of \$35 billion](https://www.forbes.com/sites/donnafuscaldo/2019/09/19/stripe-now-has-a-pre-money-valuation-of-35-billion/#20e5591c62e6).
This goes to show the demand for quality tools for which developers can build
apps upon.

The platform you provide doesn't have to what your company is known for either.
Many companies like [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/) and
[Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs) offer an external API that
developers can use to build apps that interact with Reddit's and Twitter's
services.

I'm curious to know what you think.

- When would it be a good idea to make a company's platform a product, either by
  exposing an external API or offering some sort of infrastructure?
- When would it _not_ make sense to offer a company's platform as a product?
