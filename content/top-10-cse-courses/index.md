This article is geared toward 3rd year computer science students or people that
have some basic programming experience. You should know about loops,
conditionals, function calls, exceptions, arrays, maps, and objects. If you are
a beginner, complete [this course](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/) first
before tackling the following material.

## 1. Data Structures & Algorithms

It doesn't matter what part of the stack you are working on, software engineers
need to develop data structures to represent models of the world. In this
course, you will learn what it means to make abstractions, and you were learn
about the abstractions that are commonly used to solve problems. You will learn

- basic structures like lists, [stacks](https://skies.dev/blog/stacks) and
  queues
- more complex structures like trees and graphs
- and basic sorting and searching algorithms

This course teaches you directly the skills that are often tested during
software engineer interviews, so strictly from a getting-a-job point of view,
this course is extremely valuable.

For learning about data structures, check out
[Princeton's Algorithms course](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse421/).
This course will give you experience applying algorithms to real-world problems.

## 2. Analysis of Algorithms

You've written the perfect solution to your program. How do you know your
algorithm is correct? You can write unit tests, but how do I know the algorithm
is correct for _all possible inputs_? For this, you would need to prove your
algorithm is correct. This course on Analysis of Algorithms will teach you how
to design algorithms and rigourously prove their correctness. You will learn
about

- graph theory
- greedy algorithms
- dynamic programming
- max flow

Check out
[Stanford's course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms?) on
algorithms to get you started.

## 3. Programming Languages

Programming languages come and go. The paradigms used to apply programming
languages to specific problems stay. A course on programming languages will
teach you about

- Paradigms such as functional and object-oriented
- Dynamically-typed and statically-typed languages
- Idioms like closures, lexical scope, and mutation.

To learn about programming languages, check out
[University of Washington's course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages?).

## 4. Computer Architecture

Without a CPU, your code is just syntax in a text file. A course in computer
architecture will give you a valuable perspective when working on software. In a
computer architecture course, you will learn about

- assembly and machine code
- memory hierarchy
- CPU design - pipelining, branch prediction, register renaming

To learn computer architecture, check out the popular
[Nand to Tetris material](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer?) and
its supplementing
[Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer).

## 5. Operating Systems

An operating system is the software that sits in the middle of your apps and
your CPU. An OS is responsible for a lot of things, like concurrently running
all your applications seamlessly, storing your files on your disk, and handling
external I/O. An OS is a complex piece of software capable of wearing all these
hats.

While you may never become an operating system engineer, you will might need to
deal with multiple threaded environments in complex systems. A course on
operating systems is valuable in that it forces you to design solutions to
complex problems.

To learn operating systems, complete the
[PintOS](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs140/projects/pintos/pintos.html) labs.
Supplement your learning with
[Berkeley's course](https://cs162.eecs.berkeley.edu/) materials.

## 6. Compilers

You've written your program in Java. But your computer doesn't know what Java
is. How do you turn your code from Java code to a language the machine
understands? There is a piece of software called a "compiler" for that.

A course on compilers will give you a deeper understanding of programming
languages and how they are implemented. It will demystify what is going on when
you hit the big green compile button or type `gcc` into your shell. A course on
compilers will teach you about

- regular expressions and grammars
- abstract syntax trees to represent programs
- code semantics, optimization, and generation

To learn compilers, check out
[Stanford's course](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/soe-ycscs1-compilers).

## 7. Computer Networks

The internet is kind of a big deal. I mean, without it, you probably wouldn't be
reading this article. But how do computers talk to each other? In a course on
networks, you will learn how computers communicate over the network. You will
learn about a lot of the technologies that are prevelant in today's networks,
such as IP, TCP, HTTP, and so forth.

Check out
[MIT's course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-829-computer-networks-fall-2002/index.html)
to learn about computer networks.

## 8. Distributed Systems

Most of the systems that tech companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook are
using are distributed systems. Google
[allegedly](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-search-statistics#:~:text=Google%20does%20not%20share%20their,trillion%20global%20searches%20per%20year.)
processes 70,000 search queries per second. In order to serve billions of users
at any time of the day, we need to do what is called "scaling horizontally." A
single computer can only be so fast and powerful. To address this, engineers
have _many computers_ talking to each other over the network in order to
reliability serve so many customers per second.

For learning distributed systems, do the
[dslabs projects](https://github.com/emichael/dslabs). You will get hands on
experience developing a fault tolerant, highly available, sharded key-value
store. Supplement the labs with these
[lectures from MIT](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrw6a1wE39_tb2fErI4-WkMbsvGQk9_UB).

## 9. Database Systems

Big data is a major part of society now. It doesn't matter what type of

To learn databases, complete the SimpleDB project. The
[lab specifications](https://github.com/MIT-DB-Class/course-info-2018) and
[project repo](https://github.com/MIT-DB-Class/simple-db-hw) are all you need to
complete these labs. Again, Google is your friend for searching and learning
about things as needed. Keywords include:

- SQL query language
- Database Transactions
- Two-phase commit protocol

## 10. Computer Security

Name a piece of software that is not at threat by attackers. Any real
application or software service is vulnerable to being attacked by bad actors.
In a course on security, you would learn about common thread models like XSS,
SQL injection, buffer overflow, and plenty of others.

Knowing how to secure your app could mean saving your software service from
serious damage. I don't have any one particular course I recommend for security.
Search YouTube to help you learn some common
[security topics](https://www.pentasecurity.com/blog/top-7-common-types-cyberattacks-web-applications/).

## Bonus Courses

Technology is always evolving. Here are 2 more courses that could be of interest
depending on interest.

### 11. Human-Computer Interaction

Making your app accessible and easy to use is perhaps just as important as the
software system it runs on. In this course, you learn how to design novel
interfaces that can applied to everything from web and mobile interfaces to
point-of-sale systems and ATM machines. This course will teach you principals on
designing interfaces that are enjoyable to use.

Check out
[Don't Make Me Think](https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758)
to get you started. [Refactoring UI](https://refactoringui.com/) is great for
some tactical design tips that you can start applying to your interfaces right
away.

### 12. Machine Learning

The time is now. Machine Learning is all around us. This course will teach you
about the basics of the algorithms that recommend videos on YouTube, serve
personalized ads, self-drive cars, and guess "hot dog" or "not hot dog".

**Spoiler alert:** It's math. In particular,

- linear algebra
- probability
- statistics
- calculus

We use probability and statistics to make predictions and linear algebra to
process many rows and columns of data in parallel. This course will demystify
the technology behind machine learning and has been a viable career path in
recent times.

To learn Machine Learning, check out these resources:

- [Machine Learning - Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
- [Deep Learning - Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

If you want to go deep with designing novel machine learning algebra, you should
study the mathematics I listed above.
