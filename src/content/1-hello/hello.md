## Hello world

I am Sean.

How are you doing today?

### Getting started

So first you will want to write some JavaScript.

```javascript
const hello = "hi how are you?"

let template = `
  here is a template string!
`
```

Then print "Hello world" in Python.

```python
def hello():
    print('hello world')
```

How is it going today?

#### Heading 4

Here is a [nice link](#) that will take you somewhere cool.

> Here is a nice quote by someone.

And a nice image

Not bad right?

And now I'll list some stuff

- Hi how are you
- What's going on?
- Not much?

And some numerics

1. First do this
2. Then do that
3. Then you're ready

Some **strong** text as well as some _emphasized_ text.
Here is some `inline code` as well.
