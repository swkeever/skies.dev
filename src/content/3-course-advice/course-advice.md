## Introduction

This purpose of this document is to provide some guidance on what electives you might want to consider to prepare for common software engineer job titles.

I break down the suggestions into 3 different engineering roles:

- [Frontend](#frontend-engineer)
- [Backend](#backend-engineer)
- [Data Science](#data-science-engineer)

To conclude, I give some general advice that applies to all students intersted in becoming software engineers. I give my opinions on the hardest and easiests courses, as well as courses I think everyone should take.

To limit scope, I don't include classes that are:

- **Required for CSE majors**--you have to take those classes anyway.
- **Prerequisites**. If CSE451 is suggested, it is implied that CSE333 should also be taken.
- **Special topics courses.** Since these courses are always changing, I'm only including courses in the core cirriculum.
- **Graduate level.** This document is aimed at undergrads, so I exclude 5xx classes.

### Who am I and why did I write this document?

I'm part of the Class of 2020. Ever since I started at UW as a transfer student, I've taken a lot of interest in finding out the best classes to take to best prepare for industry.

I've taken many of the courses I list. For the courses I haven't taken, I've researched what the courses entail, and have collected feedback from other students who have taken those classes.

Thus, I believe I'm in a good position to offer some course advice.

### Almost ready?

Note **these suggestions are not endorsed by the Paul Allen School.** For an endorsed list of suggested courses, you can check out [Course Pathways](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/courses/course-pathways).

OK, let's get started!

## Frontend Engineer

This list is for people intersetd in:

- user interfaces
- usability
- user experience

### Core

- [CSE440 Human Computer Interaction](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse440/): Teaches design of effective user interfaces and how to user testing.
- [CSE340 Interaction Programming](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse340/): Introduces mobile development for Android. The high-level skills you learn from this class should be transferrable should you want to develop for iOS.
- [CSE154 Web Development](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/): Introduces web development including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Also consider

- [CSE403 Software Engineering](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse403/): This course usually lets you develop an open-ended project on a team. This is another good opportunity to practice developing user interfaces and doing usability testing.
- [CSE341 Programming Languages](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse403/): Knowing how to recognize programming paradigms is especially useful for web development, due to the quickly evolving nature of JavaScript frameworks.

## Backend Engineer

This list is for people interested in:

- backend
- site-reliability
- systems

### Core

- [CSE452 Distributed Systems](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse452/): Most systems these days are distributed systems. This course will give an opportunity to develop distributed, fault tolerant systems.
- [CSE451 Operating Systems](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse451/)
- [CSE444 Database Internals](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse444/)

### Also consider

- [CSE469 Computer Architecture](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse469/): Getting a deeper understanding of how a CPU works is extremely valuable, _especially_ if you're interested in systems engineering.
- [CSE461 Networks](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse461/): This course is great for learning a lot of the terminology in computer networks and getting some practical experience networking. Take this class when the TOR project is offered.
- [CSE401 Compilers](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse401/): As a platform engineer, you may need to kn

## Data Science

If you know you want to data science, UW offers a [Data Science option](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/ugrad/courses/data-science), which is fairly close to the courses I list here.

### Core

- [CSE446 Machine Learning](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse446/): ML permuates a lot of modern AI, from recommender systems, image recognition, language processing, etc.
- [CSE442 Data Visualization](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse442/): A big portion of a data scientist's job is visualizing data.
- [CSE444 Database Internals](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse444/): Data is often stored in relational databases; knowing how these sytems are implemented can provide valuable insight.

### Also consider

- [CSE469 Computer Architecture](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse469/): Why do we care about GPUs and vectorization for machine learning? Learning computer architecture can give you invaluable perspective when developing data mining systems.
- [CSE473 Artificial Intelligence](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse473/): This is a nice course for dipping your toes into AI. It's not too heavy on the math, and gives a nice intro to a lot of AI topics including reinforcement learning, which has seen growth in popularity.

UW CSE also offers other courses that cover some niche areas in AI.

- [CSE447 Natural Language Processing](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse447/)
- [CSE455 Computer Vision](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse455/)
- [CSE478 Autonomous Robotics](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse478/)
- [CSE427 Computational Biology](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse427/)

There's also quite a bit of special topics AI courses that pop up frequently, so watch out for those too.

## General advice

Below are some courses that would benefit any software engineer, no matter the speciality.

- [CSE421 Algorithms](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse421/): Most tech companies want you to be able to solve algorithms/data structures problems. This course will you help you develop a mental framework for understanding algorithms.
- [CSE484 Computer Security](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse484/): No matter what you do as a software engineer, you should have some awareness about security.

I recommend exploring a variety of the courses while in undergrad. This is a great time to figure out what you actually like to do. I would advise not to study a subject just because it is trendy, because that will be an constant uphill battle. As cliche as it sounds, find an area you're interested in, run with that, and there will be opportunities for you.

### Challenging courses

Often I find the most challenging courses that students find most rewarding. Here's what I think were the most challenging CSE courses, in no particular order:

- [CSE451 Operating Systems](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse451/): Debugging concurrent systems is hard. This course starts you off with a fairly complete OS kernel that you get to extend throughout the quarter.
- [CSE452 Distributed Systems](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse452/): Debugging concurrent systems is hard, especially when we can't rely on network connections to send messages or rely on nodes to not crash.
- [CSE446 Machine Learning](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse446/): This course can be a _lot_ of math, depending on who teaches it. You should feel comfortable (or ready to re-learn) linear algebra, calculus, stats, and probability before taking this course.
- [CSE469 Computer Architecture](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse469/): You implement a 5-stage pipelining CPU in SystemVerilog.
- [CSE421 Algorithms](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse421/): If CSE311 and CSE332 had a baby, it would be this course. Get ready to prove correctness of all your favorite algorithms.

### Easiest courses

These courses are good to take while you're taking other hard courses concurrently.

- [CSE484 Computer Security](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse451/): 3 reasonably sized labs that you can work on in groups of 3. No midterm/final. Easy final project. Possibly the lightest workload of all the CSE classes.
- [CSE341 Programming Languages](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse451/): This course might feel harder if you're newer to CS or don't have much exposure to languages outside of Java. Otherwise, it's often considered one of the easiest CSE courses.
- [CSE473 Artificial Intelligence](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse473/): The bulk of the work is 4 labs where you implement AI's for Pacman. This course is often considered one of the easier courses.
