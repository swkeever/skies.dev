# Uses

In this page, I list out various tools and technologies I use on a daily basis.
Let me know if you have any questions about any of them.

## Editor and IDE

I like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as a general purpose
editor. Especially for

- Web development
- Scripting
- General-purpose text editing

For compiled languages such as Java, I think
[JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) IDEs are great.

If I need a terminal-based editor, I prefer [Vim](https://www.vim.org/).

## Desktop Apps

My go-to desktop apps, in addition to the editors/IDEs listed above, are

- [Brave](https://brave.com/) as my everyday browser.
- [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/) for music.
- [Discord](https://discord.com/) for chatting with friends and dev communities.
- [VMWare](https://www.vmware.com/) for using Windows on Linux.

## Desk Setup

  [Dell UltraSharp 27" monitors](https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-ultrasharp-27-monitor-u2719d/apd/210-arcv).
