# About

My name is **Sean Keever**. 

I am a developer currently living in Seattle, WA. I
graduated from the University of Washington with a **bachelor's degree in
Computer Engineering**.

> Fun fact. I worked on a farm to help pay for college. I wrote about it in my
> [personal statement](/blog/personal-statement) for admission to UW.

I'm **currently working at OfferUp** from home. I work with the Discovery team
who is responsible for search within the app.

In terms of development, I am interested in

- Frontend web development
- Microservice architectures
- Open source software

In terms of my other interests:

- **Music**. I play guitar and piano. I used to be big into recording
  electronic, hip hop, and pop music. These days I play casually!
- **Video games**. I currently have a Switch. Probably my favorite game is
  Legend of Zelda for the memories it brings. I am excited about Microsoft
  Flight Simulator, Gran Turismo 7, and Last of Us.
- **Learning things**. I love learning new things from books, podcasts, and
  videos. When I feel somewhat confident about a subject, I like to
  [blog about it](/blog).
