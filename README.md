# Skies Blog

ðŸ”— [https://skies.dev](https://skies.dev)

This project was forked from
[Gatsby's default starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default).

## Writing articles

To intialize a new blog, I recommend using the `create-blog` CLI.

```
npm run create-blog
```

**Important!**

The `create-blog` requires access to the Unsplash API. Create a `.env` file in
the project root and set the following

```bash
UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=<your-access-key>
UNSPLASH_SECRET_KEY=<your-secret-key>
UNSPLASH_API_URL=https://api.unsplash.com
```
